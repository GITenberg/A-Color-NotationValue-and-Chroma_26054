<h3>AUTHOR’S PREFACE.</h3>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>At various times during the past ten years, the gist of these pages
has been given in the form of lectures to students of the Normal Art
School, the Art Teachers’ Association, and the Twentieth Century Club.
In October of last year it was presented before the Society of Arts of
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, at the suggestion of
Professor Charles R. Cross.</p>

<p>Grateful acknowledgment is due to many whose helpful criticism has
aided in its development, notably Mr. Benjamin Ives Gilman, Secretary of
the Museum of Fine Arts, Professor Harry E. Clifford, of the Institute,
and Mr. Myron T. Pritchard, master of the Everett School, Boston.</p>

<h3>PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION.</h3>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>The new illustrations in this edition are facsimiles of children’s
studies with measured color, made under ordinary school-room conditions.
Notes and appendices are introduced to meet the questions most
frequently asked, stress being laid on the unbalanced nature of colors
usually given to beginners, and the mischief done by teaching that red,
yellow, and blue are primary hues.</p>

<p>The need of a scientific basis for color values is also emphasized,
believing this to be essential in the discipline of the color sense.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>The lack of definiteness which is at present so general in color
nomenclature, is due in large measure to the failure to appreciate the
fundamental characteristics on which color differences depend. For the
physicist, the expression of the wave length of any particular light is
in most cases sufficient, but in the great majority of instances where
colors are referred to, something more than this and something easier of
realization is essential.</p>

<p>The attempt to express color relations by using merely two
dimensions, or two definite characteristics, can never lead to a
successful system. For this reason alone the system proposed by Mr.
Munsell, with its three dimensions of hue, value, and chroma, is a
decided step in advance over any previous proposition. By means of these
three dimensions it is possible to completely express any particular
color, and to differentiate it from colors ordinarily classed as of the
same general character.</p>

<p>The expression of the essential characteristics of a color is,
however, not all that is necessary. There must be some accurate and not
too complicated system for duplicating these characteristics, one which
shall not alter with time or place, and which shall be susceptible of
easy and accurate redetermination. From the teaching standpoint also a
logical and sequential development is absolutely essential. This Mr.
Munsell seems to have most successfully accomplished.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
<p>In the determination of his relationships he has made use of
distinctly scientific methods, and there seems no reason why his
suggestions should not lead to an exact and definite system of color
essentials. The Munsell photometer, which is briefly referred to, is an
instrument of wide range, high precision, and great sensitiveness, and
permits the valuations which are necessary in his system to be
accurately made. We all appreciate the necessity for some improvement in
our ideas of color, and the natural inference is that the training
should be begun in early youth. The present system in its modified form
possesses elements of simplicity and attractiveness which should appeal
to children, and give them almost unconsciously a power of
discrimination which would prove of immense value in later life. The
possibilities in this system are very great, and it has been a privilege
to be allowed during the past few years to keep in touch with its
development. I&nbsp;cannot but feel that we have here not only a
rational color nomenclature, but also a system of scientific importance
and of practical value.</p>

COLOR NAMES.</h3>


<p>Writing from Samoa to Sidney Colvin in London, Stevenson<a class =
"tag" name = "tag1" id = "tag1" href = "#note1">1</a> says: “Perhaps in
the same way it might amuse you to send us any pattern of wall paper
that might strike you as cheap, pretty, and suitable for a room in a hot
and extremely bright climate. It should be borne in mind that our
climate can be extremely dark, too. Our sitting-room is to be in
varnished wood. The room I have particularly in mind is a sort of bed
and sitting room, pretty large, lit on three sides, and the colour in
favour of its proprietor at present is a topazy yellow. But then with
what colour to relieve it? For a little work-room of my own at the back
I should rather like to see some patterns of unglossy&mdash;well, I’ll
be hanged if I can describe this red. It’s not Turkish, and it’s not
Roman, and it’s not Indian; but it seems to partake of the last two, and
yet it can’t be either of them, because it ought to be able to go with
vermilion. Ah, what a tangled web we weave! Anyway, with what brains you
have left choose me and send me some&mdash;many&mdash;patterns of the
exact shade.”</p>

<p><a name = "para1" id = "para1">(1)</a>
Where could be found a more delightful cry for some rational way to
describe color? He wants “a topazy yellow” and a red that is not Turkish
nor Roman nor Indian, but that “seems to partake of the last two, and
yet it can’t be either of them.” As a cap to the climax comes his demand
for “patterns of the exact shade.” Thus one of the clearest and most
forceful writers of
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
English finds himself unable to describe the color he wants. And why?
Simply because popular language does not clearly state a single one of
the three qualities united in every color, and which must be known
before one may even hope to convey his color conceptions to another.</p>

<p><a name = "para2" id = "para2">(2)</a>
The incongruous and bizarre nature of our present color names must
appear to any thoughtful person. Baby blue, peacock blue, Nile green,
apple green, lemon yellow, straw yellow, rose pink, heliotrope, royal
purple, Magenta, Solferino, plum, and automobile are popular terms,
conveying different ideas to different persons and utterly failing to
define colors. The terms used for a single hue, such as pea green, sea
green, olive green, grass green, sage green, evergreen, invisible green,
are not to be trusted in ordering a piece of cloth. They invite mistakes
and disappointment. Not only are they inaccurate: they are
inappropriate. Can we imagine musical tones called lark, canary,
cockatoo, crow, cat, dog, or mouse, because they bear some distant
resemblance to the cries of those animals? See paragraph <a href =
"#para131">131</a>.</p>

<h5>Color needs a system.</h5>

<p><a name = "para3" id = "para3">(3)</a>
Music is equipped with a system by which it defines each sound in terms
of its pitch, intensify, and duration, without dragging in loose
allusions to the endlessly varying sounds of nature. So should color be
supplied with an appropriate system, based on the hue, value, and
chroma<a class = "tag" name = "tag2" id = "tag2" href = "#note2">2</a>
of our sensations, and not attempting to describe them by the indefinite
and varying colors of natural objects. The system now to be considered
portrays the three dimensions of color, and measures each by an
appropriate scale. It does not rest upon the whim of an individual, but
upon physical measurements made possible by special color
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
apparatus. The results may be tested by any one who comes to the problem
with “a clear mind, a&nbsp;good eye, and a fair supply of patience.”</p>

<h5>Clear mental images make clear speech. Vague thoughts find vague
utterance.</h5>

<p><a name = "para4" id = "para4">(4)</a>
The child gathers flowers, hoards colored beads, chases butterflies, and
begs for the gaudiest painted toys. At first his strong color sensations
are sufficiently described by the simple terms of red, yellow, green,
blue, and purple. But he soon sees that some are light, while others are
dark, and later comes to perceive that each hue has many grayer degrees.
Now, if he wants to describe a particular red,&mdash;such as that of his
faded cap,&mdash;he is not content to merely call it red, since he is
aware of other red objects which are very unlike it. So he gropes for
means to define this particular red; and, having no standard of
comparison,&mdash;no scale by which to estimate,&mdash;he hesitatingly
says it is a “sort of dull red.”</p>

<p><a name = "para5" id = "para5">(5)</a>
Thus early is he cramped by the poverty of color language. He has never
been given an appropriate word for this color quality, and has to borrow
one signifying the opposite of sharp, which belongs to edge tools rather
than to colors.</p>

<h5>Most color terms are borrowed from other senses.</h5>

<p><a name = "para6" id = "para6">(6)</a>
When his older sister refers to the “tone” of her green dress, or speaks
of the “key of color” in a picture, he is naturally confused, because
tone and key are terms associated in his mind with music. It may not be
long before he will hear that “a color note has been pitched too high,”
or that a certain artist “paints in a minor key.” All these terms lead
to mixed and indefinite ideas, and leave him unequipped for the clear
expression of color qualities.</p>

<p><a name = "para7" id = "para7">(7)</a>
Musical art is not so handicapped. It has an established
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
scale with measured intervals and definite terms. Likewise, coloristic
art must establish a scale, measure its intervals, and name its
qualities in unmistakable fashion.</p>

<h5>Color has three dimensions.</h5>

<p><a name = "para8" id = "para8">(8)</a>
It may sound strange to say that color has three dimensions, but it is
easily proved by the fact that each of them can be measured. Thus in the
case of the boy’s faded cap its redness or <span class =
"smallroman">HUE</span><a class = "tag" name = "tag3" id = "tag3" href =
"#note3">3</a> is determined by one instrument; the amount of light in
the red, which is its <span class = "smallroman">VALUE</span>,<a class =
"tag" href = "#note3">3</a> is found by another instrument; while still
a third instrument determines the purity or <span class =
"smallroman">CHROMA</span><a class = "tag" href = "#note3">3</a> of the
red.</p>

<p>The omission of any one of these three qualities leaves us in doubt
as to the character of a color, just as truly as the character of this
studio would remain undefined if the length were omitted and we
described it as 22 feet wide by 14 feet high. The imagination would be
free to ascribe any length it chose, from 25 to 100 feet. This length
might be differently conceived by every individual who tried to supply
the missing factor.</p>

To illustrate the tri-dimensional nature of colors. Suppose we peel an
orange and divide it in five parts, leaving the sections slightly
connected below (Fig.&nbsp;4). Then let us say that all the reds we have
ever seen are gathered in one of the sections, all yellows in another,
all greens in the third, blues in the fourth, and purples in the fifth.
Next we will assort these <span class = "smallroman">HUES</span> in each
section so that the lightest are near the top, and grade regularly to
the darkest near the bottom. A&nbsp;white wafer connects all the
sections at the top, and a black wafer may be added beneath. See <a href
= "#plateI">Plate&nbsp;I</a>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">13</span>
<p><a name = "para10" id = "para10">(10)</a>
The fruit is then filled with assorted colors, graded from white to
black, according to their <span class = "smallroman">VALUES</span>, and
disposed by their <span class = "smallroman">HUES</span> in the five
sections. A&nbsp;slice near the top will uncover light values in all
hues, and a slice near the bottom will find dark values in the same
hues. A&nbsp;slice across the middle discloses a circuit of hues all of
<span class = "smallroman">MIDDLE VALUE</span>; that is, midway between
the extremes of white and black.</p>

<p><a name = "para11" id = "para11">(11)</a>
Two color dimensions are thus shown in the orange, and it remains to
exhibit the third, which is called <span class =
"smallroman">CHROMA</span>, or strength of color. To do this, we have
only to take each section in turn, and, without disturbing the values
already assorted, shove the grayest in toward the narrow edge, and grade
outward to the purest on the surface. Each slice across the fruit still
shows the circuit of hues in one uniform value; but the strong chromas
are at the outside, while grayer and grayer chromas make a gradation
inward to neutral gray at the centre, where all trace of color
disappears. The thin edges of all sections unite in a scale of gray from
black to white, no matter what hue each contains.</p>

<p>The curved outside of each section shows its particular hue graded
from black to white; and, should the section be cut at right angles to
the thin edge, it would show the third
dimension,&mdash;chroma,&mdash;for the color is graded evenly from the
surface to neutral gray. A&nbsp;pin stuck in at any point traces the
third dimension.</p>


<h5>A color sphere can be used to unite the three dimensions of hue,
value, and chroma.</h5>

Having used the familiar structure of the orange as a help in
classifying colors, let us substitute a geometric solid, like a
sphere,<a class = "tag" name = "tag4" id = "tag4" href = "#note4">4</a>
and make use of geographical terms. The north pole is white. The south
pole is black.
<span class = "pagenum">14</span>
The equator is a circuit of middle reds, yellows, greens, blues, and
purples. Parallels above the equator describe this circuit in lighter
values, and parallels below trace it in darker values. The vertical axis
joining black and white is a neutral scale of gray values, while
perpendiculars to it (like a pin thrust into the orange) are scales of
chroma. Thus our color notions may be brought into an orderly relation
by the color sphere. Any color describes its light and strength by its
location in the solid or on the surface, and is named by its place in
the combined scales of hue, value, and chroma.</p>

<h5>Two dimensions fail to describe a color.</h5>

<p><a name = "para13" id = "para13">(13)</a>
Much of the popular misunderstanding of color is caused by ignorance of
these three dimensions or by an attempt to make two dimensions do the
work of three.</p>

<p><a name = "para14" id = "para14">(14)</a>
Flat diagrams showing hues and values, but omitting to define chromas,
are as incomplete as would be a map of Switzerland with the mountains
left out, or a harbor chart without indications of the depth of water.
We find by aid of the measuring instruments that pigments are very
unequal in this third dimension,&mdash;chroma,&mdash;producing mountains
and valleys on the color sphere, so that, when the color system is
worked out in pigments and charted, some colors must be traced well out
beyond the spherical surface (paragraphs <a href =
"#para125">125&ndash;127</a>). Indeed, a&nbsp;<span class =
"smallroman">COLOR TREE</span><a class = "tag" name = "tag5" id = "tag5"
href = "#note5">5</a> is needed to display by the unequal levels and
lengths of its branches the individuality of pigment colors. But,
whatever solid or figure is used to illustrate color relations, it must
combine the three scales of hue, value, and chroma, and these definite
scales furnish a name for every color based upon its intrinsic
qualities, and free from terms purloined in other sensations, or caught
from the fluctuating colors of natural objects.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">15</span>
<h5>How this system describes the spectrum.</h5>

<p><a name = "para15" id = "para15">(15)</a>
The solar spectrum and rainbow are the most stimulating color
experiences with which we are acquainted. Can they be described by this
solid system?</p>

<p><a name = "para16" id = "para16">(16)</a>
The lightest part of the spectrum is a narrow field of greenish yellow,
grading into darker red on one side and into darker green upon the
other, followed by still darker blue and purple. Upon the sphere the
values of these spectral colors trace a path high up on the yellow
section, near white, and slanting downward across the red and green
sections, which are traversed near the level of the equator, it goes on
to cross the blue and purple well down toward black.</p>

<p><a name = "para17" id = "para17">(17)</a>
This forms an inclined circuit, crossing the equator at opposite points,
and suggests the ecliptic or the rings of Saturn (see outside cover).
A&nbsp;pale rainbow would describe a slanting circuit nearer white, and
a dimmer one would fall within the sphere, while an intensely brilliant
spectrum projects far beyond the surface of the sphere, so greatly is
the chroma of its hues in excess of the common pigments with which we
work out our problems.</p>

<p><a name = "para18" id = "para18">(18)</a>
At the outset it is well to recognize the place of the spectrum in this
system, not only because it is the established basis of scientific
study, but especially because the invariable order assumed by its hues
is the only stable hint which Nature affords us in her infinite color
play.</p>

<p><a name = "para19" id = "para19">(19)</a>
All our color sensations are included in the color solid. None are left
out by its scales of hue, value, and chroma. Indeed, the imagination is
led to conceive and locate still purer colors than any we now possess.
Such increased degrees of color sensation can be named, and clearly
conveyed by symbols to another person as soon as the system is
comprehended.</p>

Appendix to Chapter I.</a></h4>

<h5>Misnomers for Color.</h5>

<p>The Century Dictionary helps an intelligent study of color by its
clear definitions and cross-references to <span class =
"smallroman">HUE</span>, <span class = "smallroman">VALUE</span>, and
<span class = "smallroman">CHROMA</span>,&mdash;leaving no excuse for
those who would confuse these three qualities or treat a degree of any
quality as the quality itself.</p>

<p>Obscure statements were frequent in text-books before these new
definitions appeared. Thus the term “shade” should be applied only to
darkened values, and not to hues or chromas. Yet one writer says, “This
yellow shades into green,” which is certainly a change of hue, and then
speaks of “a brighter shade” in spite of his evident intention to
suggest a stronger chroma, which is neither a shade nor brighter
luminosity.</p>

<p>Children gain wrong notions of “tint and shade” from the so-called
standard colors shown to them, which present “tints” of red and blue
much darker than the “shades” of yellow. This is bewildering, and, like
their elders, they soon drop into the loose habit of calling any degree
of color-strength or color-light a “shade.” <i>Value</i> is a better
term to describe the light which color reflects to the eye, and all
color values, light or dark, are measured by the <i>value-scale</i>.</p>

<p>“Tone” is used in a confusing way to mean different things. Thus in
the same sentence we see it refers to a single touch of the
brush,&mdash;which is not a tone, but a paint spot,&mdash;and then we
<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
read that the “tone of the canvas is golden.” This cannot mean that each
paint spot is the color of gold, but is intended to suggest that the
various objects depicted seem enveloped in a yellow atmosphere. Tone is,
in fact, a&nbsp;musical term appropriate to sound, but out of place in
color. It seems better to call the brush touch a <i>color-spot</i>: then
the result of an harmonious relation between all the spots is
<i>color-envelope</i>, or, as in Rood, “the chromatic composition.”</p>

<p>“Intensity” is a misleading term, if chroma be intended, for it
depends on the relative light of spectral hues. It is a degree rather
than a quality, as appears in the expressions, intense heat, light,
sound,&mdash;intensity of stimulus and reaction. Being a degree of many
qualities, it should not be used to describe the quality itself. The
word becomes especially unfit when used to describe two very different
phases of a color,&mdash;as its intense illumination, where the chroma
is greatly weakened, and the strongest chroma which is found in a much
lower value. “Purity” is also to be avoided in speaking of pigments, for
not one of our pigments represents a single pure ray of the
spectrum.</p>

<p>Examples are constantly found of the mental blur caused by such
unfortunate terms, and, since misunderstanding becomes impossible with
measured degrees of hue, value, and chroma, it seems only a question of
time when they will take the place of tint, tone, shade, purity and
intensity.</p>

COLOR QUALITIES.</h3>


<p><a name = "para20" id = "para20">(20)</a>
The three color qualities are hue, value, and chroma.</p>

<h5>HUE is the name of a color.</h5>

<p><a name = "para21" id = "para21">(21)</a>
Hue is the quality by which we distinguish one color from another, as a
red from a yellow, a&nbsp;green, a&nbsp;blue, or a purple. This names
the hue, but does not tell whether it is light or dark, weak or
strong,&mdash;leaving us in doubt as to its value and its chroma.</p>

<p>Science attributes this quality to difference in the LENGTH of ether
waves impinging on the retina, which causes the sensation of color. The
wave length M. 5269 gives a sensation of green, while M. 6867 gives a
sensation of red.<a class = "tag" name = "tag6" id = "tag6" href =
"#note6">6</a></p>

<h5>VALUE is the light of a color.</h5>

<p><a name = "para22" id = "para22">(22)</a>
Value is the quality by which we distinguish a light color from a dark
one. Color values are loosely called tints and shades, but the terms are
frequently misapplied. A&nbsp;tint should be a light value, and a shade
should be darker; but the word “shade” has become a general term for any
sort of color, so that a shade of yellow may prove to be lighter than a
tint of blue. A&nbsp;photometric<a class = "tag" name = "tag7" id =
"tag7" href = "#note7">7</a> scale of value places all colors in
relation to the extremes of white and black, but cannot describe their
hue or their chroma.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
<p>Science describes this quality as due to difference in the <span
class = "smallroman">HEIGHT</span> or amplitude of ether waves impinging
on the retina. Small amplitudes of the wave lengths given in paragraph
<a href = "#para21">21</a> produce the sensation of dark green and dark
red: larger amplitudes give the sensation of lighter green and lighter
red.</p>

<h5>CHROMA is the strength of a color.</h5>

<p><a name = "para23" id = "para23">(23)</a>
Chroma is the quality by which we distinguish a strong color from a weak
one. To say that a rug is strong in color gives no hint of its hues or
values, only its chromas. Loss of chroma is loosely called fading, but
this word is frequently used to include changes of value and hue. Take
two autumn leaves, identical in color, and expose one to the weather,
while the other is waxed and pressed in a book. Soon the exposed leaf
fades into a neutral gray, while the protected one preserves its strong
chroma almost intact. If, in fading, the leaf does not change its hue or
its value, there is only a loss of chroma, but the fading process is
more likely to induce some change of the other two qualities. Fading,
however, cannot define these changes.</p>

<p>Science describes chroma as the purity of one wave length separated
from all others. Other wave lengths, <span class =
"smallroman">INTERMINGLING</span>, make its chroma less pure.
A&nbsp;beam of daylight can combine all wave lengths in such balance as
to give the sensation of whiteness, because no single wave is in
excess.<a class = "tag" name = "tag8" id = "tag8" href =
"#note8">8</a></p>

<p><a name = "para24" id = "para24">(24)</a>
The color sphere (see Fig. 1) is a convenient model to illustrate these
three qualities,&mdash;hue, value, and chroma,&mdash;and unite them by
measured scales.</p>

<p><a name = "para25" id = "para25">(25)</a>
<span class = "illustration">
<a name = "fig1" id = "fig1" href = "images/fig1_large.png"
target = "_blank">
<img src = "images/fig1.png" width = "109" height = "105"
alt = "see text"></a></span>
The north pole of the color sphere is white, and the south pole black.
Value or luminosity of colors ranges between these two extremes. This is
the vertical scale, to be memorized as <i>V</i>,
<span class = "pagenum">20</span>
the initial for both value and vertical. Vertical movement through color
may thus be thought of as a change of value, but not as a change of hue
or of chroma. Hues of color are spread around the equator of the sphere.
This is a horizontal scale, memorized as <i>H</i>, the initial for both
hue and horizontal. Horizontal movement around the color solid is thus
thought of as a change of hue, but not of value or of chroma.
A&nbsp;line inward from the strong surface hues to the neutral gray
axis, traces the graying of each color, which is loss of chroma, and
conversely a line beginning with neutral gray at the vertical axis, and
becoming more and more colored until it passes outside the sphere, is a
scale of chroma, which is memorized as <i>C</i>, the initial both for
chroma and centre. Thus the sphere lends its three dimensions to color
description, and a color applied anywhere within, without, or on its
surface is located and named by its degree of hue, of value, and of
chroma.</p>


<h5>HUES first appeal to the child, VALUES next, and CHROMAS last.</h5>

<p><a name = "para26" id = "para26">(26)</a>
Color education begins with ability to recognize and name certain hues,
such as red, yellow, green, blue, and purple (see paragraphs <a href =
"#para182">182 and 183</a>). Nature presents these hues in union with
such varieties of value and chroma that, unless there be some standard
of comparison, it is impossible for one person to describe them
intelligently to another.</p>

<p><a name = "para27" id = "para27">(27)</a>
The solar spectrum forms a basis for scientific color analysis, taught
in technical schools; but it is quite beyond the comprehension of a
child. He needs something more tangible and constantly in view to train
his color notions. He needs to handle colors, place them side by side
for comparison, imitate them with
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
crayons, paints, and colored stuffs, so as to test the growth of
perception, and learn by simple yet accurate terms to describe each by
its hue, its value, and its chroma.</p>

<p><a name = "para28" id = "para28">(28)</a>
Pigments, rather than the solar spectrum, are the practical agents of
color work. Certain of them, selected and measured by this system (see
<a href = "#chapV">Chapter V.</a>), will be known as <span class =
"smallroman">MIDDLE COLORS</span>, because they stand midway in the
scales of value and chroma. These middle colors are preserved in
imperishable enamels,<a class = "tag" name = "tag9" id = "tag9" href =
"#note9">9</a> so that the child may handle and fix them in his memory,
and thus gain a permanent basis for comparing all degrees of color. He
learns to grade each middle color to its extremes of value and
chroma.</p>

<p><a name = "para29" id = "para29">(29)</a>
Experiments with crayons and paints, and efforts to match middle colors,
train his color sense to finer perceptions. Having learned to name
colors, he compares them with the enamels of middle value, and can
describe how light or dark they are. Later he perceives their
differences of strength, and, comparing them with the enamels of middle
chroma, can describe how weak or strong they are. Thus the full
significance of these middle colors as a practical basis for all color
estimates becomes apparent; and, when at a more advanced stage he
studies the best examples of decorative color, he will again encounter
them in the most beautiful products of Oriental art.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
<h5>Is it possible to define the endless varieties of color?</h5>

<p><a name = "para30" id = "para30">(30)</a>
At first glance it would seem almost hopeless to attempt the naming of
every kind and degree of color. But, if all these varieties possess the
same three qualities, only in different degrees, and if each quality can
be measured by a scale, then there is a clue to this labyrinth.</p>

<h5>A COLOR SPHERE and COLOR TREE to unite hue, value, and chroma.</h5>

<p><a name = "para31" id = "para31">(31)</a>
<span class = "illustration">
<a name = "fig3" id = "fig3" href = "images/fig3_large.png"
target = "_blank">
<img src = "images/fig3.png" width = "103" height = "102"
alt = "see text"></a></span>
This clue is found in the union of these three qualities by measured
scales in a <i>color sphere and color tree</i>.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag10" id = "tag10" href = "#note10">10</a> The equator of the sphere<a
class = "tag" name = "tag11" id = "tag11" href = "#note11">11</a> may be
divided into ten parts, and serve as the scale of hue, marked&nbsp;R,
YR,&nbsp;Y, GY,&nbsp;G, BG,&nbsp;B, PB, P, and RP. Its vertical axis may
be divided into ten parts to serve as the scale of value, numbered from
black (0) to white (10). Any perpendicular to the neutral axis is a
scale of chroma. On the plane of the equator this scale is numbered 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, from the centre to the surface.</p>


<p><a name = "para32" id = "para32">(32)</a>
This chroma scale may be raised or lowered to any level of value, always
remaining perpendicular to the axis, and serving to measure the chroma
of every hue at every level of value. The fact that some colors exceed
others to such an extent as to carry them out beyond the sphere is
proved by measuring instruments,
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
but the fact is a new one to many persons. (Figs. 2 and&nbsp;3.)</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<a name = "fig2" id = "fig2" href = "images/fig2_large.png"

title = "Figure 2. (See Figure 20) The Color Tree"></a></p>

<p><a name = "para33" id = "para33">(33)</a>
For this reason the <span class = "smallroman">COLOR TREE</span> is a
completer model than the sphere, although the simplicity of the latter
makes it best for a child’s comprehension.</p>

<p><a name = "para34" id = "para34">(34)</a>
The color tree is made by taking the vertical axis of the sphere, which
carries a scale of value, for the trunk. The branches are at right
angles to the trunk; and, as in the sphere, they carry the scale of
chroma. Colored balls on the branches tell their Hue. In order to show
the <span class = "smallroman">MAXIMA</span> of color, each branch is
attached to the trunk (or neutral axis) at a level demanded by its
value,&mdash;the yellow nearest white at the top, then the green, red,
blue, and purple branches, approaching black in the order of their lower
values. It will be remembered that the chroma of the sphere ceased with
5 at the equator. The color tree prolongs
<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
this through 6, 7, 8, and&nbsp;9. The branch ends carry colored balls,
representing the most powerful red, yellow, green, blue, and purple
pigments which we now possess, and could be lengthened, should stronger
chromas be discovered.<a class = "tag" name = "tag12" id = "tag12" href
= "#note12">12</a></p>

<p><a name = "para35" id = "para35">(35)</a>
Such models set up a permanent image of color relations. Every point is
self-described by its place in the united scales of hue, value, and
chroma. These scales fix each new perception of color in the child’s
mind by its situation in the color solid. The importance of such a
definite image can hardly be overestimated, for without it one color
sensation tends to efface another. When the child looks at a color, and
has no basis of comparison, it soon leaves a vague memory that cannot be
described. These models, on the contrary, lead to an intelligent
estimate of each color in terms of its hue, its value, and its chroma;
while the permanent enamels correct any personal bias by a definite
standard.</p>

<p><a name = "para36" id = "para36">(36)</a>
Thus defined, a color falls into logical relation with all other colors
in the system, and is easily memorized, so that its image may be
recalled at any distance of time or place by the notation.</p>

<p><a name = "para37" id = "para37">(37)</a>
These solid models help to memorize and assemble colors and the memory
is further strengthened by a simple <span class =
"smallroman">NOTATION</span>, which records each color so that it cannot
be mistaken for any other. By these written scales a child gains an
instinctive estimate of relations, so that, when he is delighted with a
new color combination, its proportions are noted and understood.</p>

<p><a name = "para38" id = "para38">(38)</a>
Musical art has long enjoyed the advantages of a definite scale and
notation. Should not the art of coloring gain by similar definition? The
musical scale is not left to personal
<span class = "pagenum">25</span>
whim, nor does it change from day to day; and something as clear and
stable would be an advantage in training the color sense.</p>

<p><a name = "para39" id = "para39">(39)</a>
Perception of color is crude at first. The child sees only the most
obvious distinctions, and prefers the strongest stimulation. But
perception soon becomes refined by exercise, and, when a child tries to
imitate the subtle colors of nature with paints, he begins to realize
that the strongest colors are not the most beautiful,&mdash;rather the
tempered ones, which may be compared to the moderate sounds in music. To
describe these tempered colors, he must estimate their hue, value, and
chroma, and be able to describe in what degree his copy departs from the
natural color. And, with this gain in perception and imitation of
natural color, he finds a strong desire to invent combinations to please
his fancy. Thus the study divides into three related attitudes, which
may be called recognition, imitation, and invention. Recognition of
color is fundamental, but it would be tedious to spend a year or two in
formal and dry exercises to train recognition of color alone; for each
step in recognition of color is best tested by exercise in its imitation
and arrangement. When perception becomes keener, emphasis can be placed
on imitation of the colors found in art and in nature, resting finally
on the selection and grouping of colors for design.<a class = "tag" name

<h5>Every color can be recognized, named, matched, imitated, and written
by its HUE, VALUE, and CHROMA.</h5>

<p><a name = "para40" id = "para40">(40)</a>
The notation used in this system places Hue (expressed by an initial) at
the left; Value (expressed by a number) at the right and above a line;
and Chroma (also expressed by
<span class = "pagenum">26</span>

<p>Hue, value, and chroma unite in every color sensation, but the child
cannot grasp them all at once. <i>Hue-difference appeals to him
first</i>, and he gains a permanent idea of five principal hues from the
enamels of <span class = "smallroman">MIDDLE COLORS</span>, learning to
name, match, imitate, and finally write them by their initials: R (red),
Y (yellow), G (green), B (blue), and P (purple). Intermediates formed by

Ten differences of hue are as many as a child can render at the outset,
yet in matching and imitating them he becomes aware of their light and
dark quality, and learns to separate it from hue as
<i>value-difference</i>. Middle colors, as implied by that name, stand
midway between white and black,&mdash;that is, on the equator of the
sphere,&mdash;so that a middle red will be written R<sup>5</sup>/,
suggesting the steps 6, 7, 8, and 9 which are above the equator, while
steps 4, 3, 2, and 1 are below. It is well to show only three values of
a color at first; for instance, the middle value contrasted with a light
and a dark one. These are written R<sup>3</sup>/, R<sup>5</sup>/,
R<sup>7</sup>/. Soon he perceives and can imitate finer differences, and
the red scale may be written entire, as R<sup>1</sup>/, R<sup>2</sup>/,
R<sup>3</sup>/, R<sup>4</sup>/, R<sup>5</sup>/, R<sup>6</sup>/,
R<sup>7</sup>/, R<sup>8</sup>/, R<sup>9</sup>/, with black as 0 and
white as&nbsp;10.</p>

<p><a name = "para42" id = "para42">(42)</a>
<i>Chroma-difference is the third</i> and most subtle color quality. The
child is already unconsciously familiar with the middle chroma of red,
having had the enamels of <span class = "smallroman">MIDDLE COLOR</span>
always
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
in view, and the red enamel is to be contrasted with the strongest and
weakest red chromas obtainable. These he writes R&nbsp;/<sub>1</sub>,
R&nbsp;/5, R&nbsp;/<sub>9</sub>, seeing that this describes the chromas
of red, but leaves out its values. R<sup>5</sup>/<sub>1</sub>,
R<sup>5</sup>/<sub>5</sub>, R<sup>5</sup>/<sub>9</sub>, is the complete
statement, showing that, while both hue and value are unchanged, the
chroma passes from grayish red to middle red (enamel first learned) and
out to the strongest red in the chroma scale obtained by vermilion.</p>

<p><a name = "para43" id = "para43">(43)</a>
It may be long before he can imitate the intervening steps of chroma,
many children finding it difficult to express more than five steps of
the chroma scale, although easily making ten steps of value and from
twenty to thirty-five steps of hue. This interesting feature is of
psychologic value, and has been followed in the color tree and color
sphere.</p>

<h5>Does such a scientific scheme leave any outlet for feeling and
personal expression of beauty?</h5>

<p><a name = "para44" id = "para44">(44)</a>
Lest this exact attitude in color study should seem inartistic, compared
with the free and almost chaotic methods in use, let it be said that the
stage thus far outlined is frankly disciplinary. It is somewhat dry and
unattractive, just as the early musical training is fatiguing without
inventive exercises. The child should be encouraged at each step to
exercise his fancy.</p>

<p><a name = "para45" id = "para45">(45)</a>
Instead of cramping his outlook upon nature, it widens his grasp of
color, and stores the memory with finer differences, supplying more
material by which to express his sense of coloristic beauty.</p>

<p><a name = "para46" id = "para46">(46)</a>
Color harmony, as now treated, is a purely personal affair, difficult to
refer to any clear principles or definite laws. The very terms by which
it seeks expression are borrowed from music, and suggest vague analogies
that fail when put to the test. Color
<span class = "pagenum">28</span>
needs a new set of expressive terms, appropriate to its qualities,
before we can make an analysis as to the harmony or discord of our color
sensations.</p>

<p><a name = "para47" id = "para47">(47)</a>
This need is supplied in the present system by measured <span class =
"smallroman">CHARTS</span>, and a <span class =
"smallroman">NOTATION</span>. Their very construction preserves the
<i>balance of colors</i>, as will be shown in the next chapter, while
the chapter on harmony (<a href = "#chapVII">Chapter VII.</a>) shows how
harmonious pairs and triads of color may be found by <span class =
"smallroman">MASKS</span> with measured intervals. In fact, practice in
the use of the charts supplies the imagination with scales and sequences
of color quite as definite and quite as easily written as those sound
intervals by which the musician conveys to others his sense of harmony.
And, although in neither art can training alone make the artist, yet a
technical grasp of these formal scales gives acquaintance with the full
range of the instrument, and is indispensable to artistic expression.
From these color scales each individual is free to choose combinations
in accord with his feeling for color harmony.</p>

<p><a name = "para51" id = "para51">(51)</a>
Having memorized these broad divisions of the study, a&nbsp;clever
teacher will introduce many a detail, to meet the mood of the class, or
correlate this subject with other studies, without for a moment losing
the thread of thought or befogging the presentation. But to range at
random in the immense field of color sensations, without plan or
definite aim in view, only courts fatigue of the retina and a chaotic
state of mind.</p>

<p><a name = "para52" id = "para52">(52)</a>
The same broad principles which govern the presentation of other ideas
apply with equal force in this study. A&nbsp;little, well apprehended,
is better than a mass of undigested facts. If the child is led to
discover, or at least to think he is discovering, new things about
color, the mind will be kept alert and seek out novel illustrations at
every step. Now and then a pupil will be found
<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
who leads both teacher and class by <i>intuitive</i> appreciation of
color, and it is a subtle question how far such a nature can be helped
or hurt by formal exercises. But such an exception is rare, and goes to
prove that systematic discipline of the color sense is necessary for
most children.</p>

<p><a name = "para53" id = "para53">(53)</a>
Outdoor nature and indoor surroundings offer endless color
illustrations. Birds, flowers, minerals, and the objects in daily use
take on a new interest when their varied colors are brought into a
conscious relation, and clearly named. A&nbsp;tri-dimensional
perception, like this sense of color, requires skilful training, and
each lesson must be simplified to the last point practicable. It must
not be too long, and should lead to some definite result which a child
can grasp and express with tolerable accuracy, while its difficulties
should be approached by easy stages, so as to avoid failure or
discouragement. The success of the present effort is the best incentive
to further achievement.</p>

When recognized for the first time, a&nbsp;middle green, blue, or
purple, is accepted by most persons as well within their color habit,
but middle red and middle yellow cause somewhat of a shock. “That isn’t
red,” they say, “it’s terra cotta.” “Yellow?” “Oh, no,
that’s&mdash;well, it’s a very peculiar shade.”</p>

<p>Yet these are as surely the middle degrees of red and yellow as are
the more familiar degrees of green, blue, and purple. This becomes
evident as soon as one accepts physical tests of color in place of
personal whim. It also opens the mind to a generally ignored fact, that
middle reds and yellows, instead of the screaming red and yellow first
given a child, are constantly found in examples of rich and beautiful
color, such as Persian rugs, Japanese prints, and the masterpieces of
painting.</p>

Unaware that the spherical arrangement had been used years before,
I&nbsp;devised a double tetrahedron to classify colors, while a student
of painting in 1879. It now appears that the sphere was common property
with psychologists, having been described by Runge in 1810. Earlier
still, Lambert had suggested a pyramidal form. Both are based on the
erroneous assumption that red, yellow, and blue are primary sensations,
and also fail to place these hues in a just scale of luminosity. My
twirling color solid and its completer development in the present model
have always made prominent the artistic feeling for color value. It
differs in this and in other ways from previous systems, and is
fortunate in possessing new apparatus to measure the degree of hue,
value, and chroma.</p>

PLATE I.<br>
THE COLOR SPHERE, with Measured Scales of<br>
HUE, VALUE, and CHROMA.</h4>


<p>The teacher of elementary grades introduces these scales of tempered
color as fast as the child’s interest is awakened to their need by the
exercises shown in Plates II. and III. Thus the Hue scale is learned
before the end of the second year, the Value scale during the next two
years, and the Chroma scale in the fifth year. By the time a child is
ten years old these definite color scales have become part of his mental
furnishing, so that he can name, write, and memorize any color
group.</p>

<p>1. <i>The Color Sphere in Skeleton.</i> This diagram shows the middle
colors on the equator, with strong red, yellow, green, blue, and purple,
each at its proper level in the value scale, and projecting in
accordance with its scale of chroma. See the complete description of
these scales in <a href = "#chapII">Chapter&nbsp;II</a>.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Color Score.</i> Fifteen typical steps taken from the color
sphere are here spread out in a flat field. The <span class =
"smallcaps">Five Middle Colors</span> form the centre level, with the
same hues in a lighter value above and in a darker value below. <a href
= "#chapVI">Chapter VI.</a> describes the making of this Score, and its
use in analyzing colors and preserving a written record of their
groups.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Value Scale and Chroma Scale.</i> Each of the five color
maxima is thus shown at its proper level in the scale of light, and
graded by uniform steps from its strongest chroma inward to neutrality
at the axis of the sphere. Pigment inequalities here become very
apparent.</p>

Let us recall the names and order of colors given in the last chapter,
with their assemblage in a sphere by the three qualities of <span class
= "smallroman">HUE</span>, <span class = "smallroman">VALUE</span>, and
<span class = "smallroman">CHROMA</span>. It will aid the memory to call
the thumb of the left hand <span class = "smallroman">RED</span>, the
forefinger <span class = "smallroman">YELLOW</span>, the middle finger
<span class = "smallroman">GREEN</span>, the ring finger <span class =
"smallroman">BLUE</span>, and the little finger <span class =
"smallroman">PURPLE</span> (Fig.&nbsp;6). When the finger tips are in a
circle, they represent a circuit of hues, which has neither beginning
nor end, for we can start with any finger and trace a sequence forward
or backward. Now close the tips together for white, and imagine that the
five strong hues have slipped down to the knuckles, where they stand for
the equator of the color Sphere. Still lower down at the wrist is
black.</p>

<p><a name = "para55" id = "para55">(55)</a>
The hand thus becomes a color holder, with white at the finger tips,
black at the wrist, strong colors around the outside, and weaker colors
within the hollow. Each finger is a scale of its own color, with white
above and black below, while the graying of all the hues is traced by
imaginary lines which meet in the middle of the hand. Thus a child’s
hand may be his substitute for the color sphere, and also make him
realize that it is filled with grayer degrees of the outside colors, all
of which melt into gray in the centre.</p>

Let this circle (Fig. 7) stand for the equator of the color sphere with
the five principal hues (written by their initials&nbsp;R, Y,&nbsp;G, B,
and&nbsp;P) spaced evenly about it. Some colors are neighbors, as red
and yellow, while others are opposites. As soon as a child experiments
with paints, he will notice the different results obtained by mixing
them.</p>

<p>First, the neighbors, that is, any pair which lie next one another,
as red and yellow, will unite to make a hue which retains a suggestion
of both. It is <i>intermediate</i> between red and yellow, and we call
it <span class = "smallroman">YELLOW-RED</span>.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag17" id = "tag17" href = "#note17">17</a></p>

<p><a name = "para57" id = "para57">(57)</a>
Green and yellow unite to form <span class =
"smallroman">GREEN-YELLOW</span>, blue and green make <span class =
"smallroman">BLUE-GREEN</span>, and so on with each succeeding pair.
These intermediates are to be written by their initials, and inserted in
their proper place between the principal hues. It is as if an orange
(paragraph&nbsp;<a href = "#para9">9</a>) were split into ten sectors
instead of five, with red, yellow, green, blue, and purple as alternate
sectors, while half of each adjoining color pair were united to form the
sector between them. The original order of five hues is in no wise
disturbed, but linked together by five intermediate steps.</p>

<p><a name = "para58" id = "para58">(58)</a>
Here is a table of the intermediates made by mixing each
pair:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "inset1 smaller">
<p>Red and yellow unite to form yellow-red (YR), popularly called
orange.<a class = "tag" href = "#note17">17</a></p>
<p>Yellow and green unite to form green-yellow (GY), popularly called
grass green.</p>
<p>Green and blue unite to form blue-green (BG), popularly called
peacock blue.</p>
<p>Blue and purple unite to form purple-blue (PB), popularly called
violet.</p>
<p>Purple and red unite to form red-purple (RP), popularly called
plum.</p>
</div>

<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
<p>Using the left hand again to hold colors, the principal hues remain
unchanged on the knuckles, but in the hollows between them are placed
intermediate hues, so that the circle now reads: red, yellow-red,
yellow, green-yellow, green, blue-green, blue, purple-blue, purple, and
red-purple, back to the red with which we started. This circuit is
easily <i>memorized</i>, so that the child may begin with any color
point, and repeat the series clock wise (that is, from left to right) or
in reverse order.</p>

<p><a name = "para59" id = "para59">(59)</a>
Each principal hue has thus made two close neighbors by mixing with the
nearest principal hue on either hand. The neighbors of red are a
yellow-red on one side and a purple-red on the other. The neighbors of
green are a green-yellow on one hand and a blue-green on the other. It
is evident that a still closer neighbor could be made by again mixing
each consecutive pair in this circle of ten hues; and, if the process
were continued long enough, the color steps would become so fine that
the eye could see only a circuit of hues melting imperceptibly one into
another.</p>

<p><a name = "para60" id = "para60">(60)</a>
But it is better for the child to gain a fixed idea of red, yellow,
green, blue, and purple, with their intermediates, before attempting to
mix pigments, and these ten steps are sufficient for primary
education.</p>

<p><a name = "para61" id = "para61">(61)</a>
Next comes the question of opposites in this circle. A&nbsp;line drawn
from red, through the centre, finds its opposite, blue-green.<a class =
"tag" name = "tag18" id = "tag18" href = "#note18">18</a> If these
colors are mixed, they unite to form gray. Indeed, the centre of the
circle stands for a middle gray, not only because it is the centre of
the neutral axis between black and white, but also because any pair of
opposites will unite to form gray.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">37</span>
<p><a name = "para62" id = "para62">(62)</a>
This is a table of five mixtures which make neutral gray:</p>

</table>

<p><a name = "para63" id = "para63">(63)</a>
But if, instead of mixing these opposite hues, we place them side by
side, the eye is so stimulated by their difference that each seems to
gain in strength; <i>i.e.</i>, each <i>enhances</i> the other when
separate, but <i>destroys</i> the other when mixed. This is a very
interesting point to be more fully illustrated by the help of a color
wheel in Chapter V., paragraph <a href = "#para106">106</a>. What we
need to remember is that the mixture of neighborly hues makes them less
stimulating to the eye, because they resemble each other, while a
mixture of opposite hues extinguishes both in a neutral gray.</p>

<h5>Hues once removed, and their mixture.</h5>

There remains the question, What will happen if we mix, not two
neighbors, nor two opposites, but <i>a pair of hues once removed in the
circle</i>, such as red and green? A&nbsp;line joining this pair does
not pass through the neutral centre, but to one side nearer yellow,
which shows that this mixture falls between neutral gray and yellow,
partaking somewhat of each. In the same way a line joining yellow and
blue shows that their mixture contains both green and gray. Indeed,
a&nbsp;line joining any two colors in the circuit may be said to
describe their union. A&nbsp;radius crossing this line passes to some
hue on the circumference, and describes by its intersection with the
first line
<span class = "pagenum">38</span>
the chroma of the color made by a mixture of the two original
colors.</p>

So far we have thought only of the plane of the equator, with its circle
of middle hues in ten steps, and studied their mixture by drawing lines
to join them. Now let us start at the neutral centre, and think upward

<p>This vertical line is the <i>neutral axis</i> joining the poles of
white and black, which represent the opposites of light and darkness.
Middle gray is half-way between. If black is called 0, and white is 10,
then the middle point is 5, with 6, 7, 8, and 9 above, while 4, 3, 2,
and 1 are below, thus making a vertical scale of grays from black to
white (Chapter II., paragraph&nbsp;<a href = "#para25">25</a>).</p>

<p>If left to personal preference, an estimate of middle value will vary
with each individual who attempts to make it. This appears in the
neutral scales already published for schools, and students who depend
upon them, discover a variation of over 10 per cent. in the selection of
middle gray. Since this <span class = "smallroman">VALUE SCALE</span>
underlies all color work, it needs accurate adjustment by scientific
means, as in scales of sound, of length, of weight, or of
temperature.</p>

<p>A <span class = "smallroman">PHOTOMETER</span> (<i>photo</i>, light,
and <i>meter</i>, a&nbsp;measure)<a class = "tag" name = "tag19" id =

<span class = "pagenum">39</span>
on the next page. It measures the relative amount of light which the eye
receives from any source, and so enables us to make a scale with any
number of regular steps. The principle on which it acts is very
simple.</p>

<p>A rectangular box, divided by a central partition into halves, has
symmetrical openings in the front walls, which permit the light to reach
two white fields placed upon the back walls. If one looks in through the
observation tube, both halves are seen to be exactly alike, and the
white fields equally illuminated. A&nbsp;valve is then fitted to one of
the front openings, so that the light in that half of the photometer may
be gradually diminished. Its white field is thus darkened by measured
degrees, and becomes black when all light is excluded by the closed
valve. While this darkening process goes on in one-half of the
instrument, the white field in the other half does not change, and,
looking into the eyepiece, the observer sees each step contrasted with
the original white. One-half is thus said to be <i>variable</i> because
of its valve, and the other side is said to be <i>fixed</i>. A&nbsp;dial
connected with the valve has a hand moving over it to show how much
light is admitted to the field in the variable half.</p>

<p>Let us now test one of these personal decisions about middle value.
A&nbsp;sample replaces the white field in the fixed half, and by means
of the valve, the white field in the variable half is alternately
darkened and lightened, until it matches the sample and the eye sees no
difference in the two. The dial then discloses the fact that this
supposedly <span class = "smallroman">MIDDLE VALUE</span> reflects only
42 per cent. of the light; that is to say, it is nearly a whole step too
low in a decimal scale. Other samples err nearly as far on the light
side of middle value, and further tests prove not only the varying color
sensitiveness of individuals, but detect a difference between the left
and right eye of the same person.</p>

<p>The vagaries of color estimate thus disclosed, lead some to seek
shelter in “feeling and inspiration”; but feeling and inspiration are
temperamental, and have nothing to do with the simple facts of vision.
A&nbsp;measured and unchanging scale is as necessary and valuable in the
training of the eye as the musical scale in the discipline of the
ear.</p>

<p>It will soon be necessary to talk of the values in each color. We may
distinguish the values on the neutral axis from color values by writing
them N<sup>1</sup>, N<sup>2</sup>, N<sup>3</sup>, N<sup>4</sup>,
N<sup>5</sup>, N<sup>6</sup>, N<sup>7</sup>, N<sup>8</sup>,
N<sup>9</sup>, N<sup>10</sup>. Such a scale makes it easy to foresee the
result of mixing light values with dark ones. Any two gray values unite
to form a gray midway between them. Thus N<sup>4</sup> and N<sup>6</sup>
being equally above and below the centre, unite to form N<sup>5</sup>,
as will also N<sup>7</sup>
<span class = "pagenum">41</span>
and N<sup>3</sup>, N<sup>8</sup> and N<sup>2</sup>, or N<sup>9</sup> and
N<sup>1</sup>. But N<sup>9</sup> and N<sup>3</sup> will unite to form
N<sup>6</sup>, which is midway between 6 and&nbsp;9.</p>

When this numbered scale of values is familiar, it serves not only to
describe light and dark grays, but the value of colors which are at the
same level in the scale. Thus R<sup>7</sup> (popularly called a tint of
red) is neither lighter nor darker than the gray of N<sup>7</sup>.
A&nbsp;numeral written above to the right always indicates <i>value</i>,
whether of a gray or a color, so that R<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>2</sup>,
R<sup>3</sup>, R<sup>4</sup>, R<sup>5</sup>, R<sup>6</sup>,
R<sup>7</sup>, R<sup>8</sup>, R<sup>9</sup>, describes a regular scale
of red values from black to white, while G<sup>1</sup>, G<sup>2</sup>,
G<sup>3</sup>, etc., is a scale of green values.</p>

This matter of a notation for colors will be more fully worked out in <a
href = "#chapVI">Chapter VI.</a>, but the letters and numerals already
described greatly simplify what we are about to consider in the mixture
and balance of colors.</p>

<h5>Mixture of light hues with dark hues.</h5>

Now that we are supplied with a decimal scale of grays, represented by
divisions of the neutral axis (N<sup>1</sup>, N<sup>2</sup>, etc.), and
a corresponding decimal scale of value for each of the ten hues ranged
about the equator (R<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>2</sup>,&mdash;YR<sup>1</sup>,
YR<sup>2</sup>,&mdash;Y<sup>1</sup>,
Y<sup>2</sup>,&mdash;GY<sup>1</sup>, GY<sup>2</sup>,&mdash;and so on),
traced by ten equidistant meridians from black to white, it is not
difficult to foresee what the mixture of any two colors will produce,
whether they are of the same level of value, as in the colors of the
equator already considered, or whether they are of different levels.</p>


<p><a name = "para69" id = "para69">(69)</a>
For instance, let us mix a light yellow (Y<sup>7</sup>) with a dark red
(R<sup>3</sup>). They are neighbors in hue, but well removed in value.
A&nbsp;line joining them centres at YR<sup>5</sup>. This describes the
result of their mixture,&mdash;a value intermediate between 7 and 3,
with a hue intermediate between R and&nbsp;Y. It is a yellow-red of
middle value, popularly called “dark orange.” But, while this term “dark
orange” rarely means the same color to three different people, these
measured scales give to YR<sup>5</sup> an unmistakable meaning, just as
the musical scale gives an unmistakable significance to the notes of its
score.</p>

<p><a name = "para70" id = "para70">(70)</a>
Evidently, this way of writing colors by their degrees of value and hue
gives clearness to what would otherwise be hard to express by the color
terms in common use.</p>

<p><a name = "para71" id = "para71">(71)</a>
If Y<sup>9</sup> and R<sup>5</sup> be chosen for mixture, we know at
once that
<span class = "pagenum">43</span>
they unite in YR<sup>7</sup>, which is two steps of the value scale
above the middle; while Y<sup>6</sup> and R<sup>2</sup> make
YR<sup>4</sup>, which is one step below the middle. Charts prepared with
this system show each of these colors and their mixture with
exactness.</p>

<p><a name = "para72" id = "para72">(72)</a>
The foregoing mixtures of dark reds and light yellows are typical of the
union of light and dark values of any neighboring hues, such as yellow
and green, green and blue, blue and purple, or purple and red. Next let
us think of the result of mixing different values in opposite hues; as,
for instance, YR<sup>7</sup> and B<sup>3</sup> (Fig. 11). To this
combination the color sphere gives a ready answer; for the middle of a
straight line through the sphere, and joining them, coincides with the
neutral centre, showing that they <i>balance in neutral gray</i>. This
is also true of any opposite pair of surface hues where the values are
equally removed from the equator.</p>

<p><a name = "para73" id = "para73">(73)</a>
<span class = "illustration">

Suppose we substitute familiar flowers for the notation, then
YR<sup>7</sup> becomes the buttercup, and B<sup>3</sup> is the wild
violet. But, in comparing the two, the eye is more stimulated by the
buttercup than by the violet, not alone because it is lighter, but
because it is stronger in chroma; that is, farther away from the neutral
axis of the sphere, and in fact out beyond its surface, as shown in
Fig.&nbsp;11.</p>

<p>The head of a pin stuck in toward the axis on the 7th level of YR may
represent the 9th step in the scale of chroma, such as the buttercup,
while the “modest” violet with a chroma of only 4, is shown by its
position to be nearer the neutral axis than the brilliant buttercup by
five steps of chroma. This is the third dimension of color, and must be
included in our notation.
<span class = "pagenum">44</span>
So we write the buttercup YR<sup>7</sup>/<sub>9</sub> and the violet
B<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>,&mdash;chroma always being written below to
the right of hue, and value always above.</p>

<p><a name = "para74" id = "para74">(74)</a>
A line joining the head of the pin mentioned above with
B<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> does not pass through the centre of the
sphere, and its middle point is nearer the buttercup than the neutral
axis, showing that the hues of the buttercup and violet <i>do not
balance in gray</i>.</p>

<h5>The neutral centre is a balancing point for colors.</h5>

<p><a name = "para75" id = "para75">(75)</a>
This raises the question, What is balance of color? Artists criticise
the color schemes of paintings as being “too light or too dark”
(unbalanced in value), “too weak or too strong” (unbalanced in chroma),
and “too hot or too cold” (unbalanced in hue), showing that this is a
fundamental idea underlying all color arrangements.</p>

<p><a name = "para76" id = "para76">(76)</a>
Let us assume that the centre of the sphere is the natural balancing
point for all colors (which will be best shown by Maxwell discs in
Chapter V., paragraphs <a href = "#para106">106&ndash;112</a>), then
color points equally removed from the centre must balance one another.
Thus white balances black. Lighter red balances darker blue-green.
Middle red balances middle blue-green. In short, every straight line
through this centre indicates opposite qualities that balance one
another. The color points so found are said to be
“<i>complementary</i>,” for each supplies what is needed to complement
or balance the other in hue, value, and chroma.</p>

<p><a name = "para77" id = "para77">(77)</a>
The true complement of the buttercup, then, is not the violet, which is
too weak in chroma to balance its strong opposite. We have no blue
flower that can equal the chroma of the buttercup. Some other means must
be found to produce a balance. One way is to use more of the weaker
color. Thus we can make
<span class = "pagenum">45</span>
a bunch of buttercups and violets, using twice as many of the latter, so
that the eye sees an <i>area</i> of blue twice as great as the
<i>area</i> of yellow-red. Area as a compensation for inequalities of
hue, value, and chroma will be further described under the harmony of
color in <a href = "#chapVII">Chapter VII.</a></p>

<p><a name = "para78" id = "para78">(78)</a>
But, before leaving this illustration of the buttercup and violet, it is
well to consider another color path connecting them which does not pass
through the sphere, <i>but around it</i> (Fig. 12). Such a path swinging
around from yellow-red to blue slants downward in value, and passes
through yellow, green-yellow, green, and blue-green, tracing a
<i>sequence of hue</i>, of which each step is less chromatic than its
predecessor.</p>

<span class = "illustration">
<a name = "fig12" id = "fig12" href = "images/fig12_large.png"
target = "_blank">
<img src = "images/fig12.png" width = "129" height = "107"
alt = "see text"></a></span>

<p>This diminishing sequence is easily written
thus,&mdash;YR<sup>8</sup>/<sub>9</sub>, Y<sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub>,
GY<sup>6</sup>/<sub>7</sub>, G<sup>5</sup>/<sub>6</sub>,
BG<sup>4</sup>/<sub>5</sub>, B<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>,&mdash;and is
shown graphically in Fig. 12. Its hue sequence is described by the
initials YR,&nbsp;Y, GY,&nbsp;G, BG, and&nbsp;B. Its value-sequence
appears in the upper numerals, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, and 3, while the
chroma-sequence is included in the lower numerals, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5,
and&nbsp;4. This gives a complete statement of the sequence, defining
its peculiarity, that at each change of hue there is a regular decrease
of value and chroma. Nature seems to be partial to this sequence,
constantly reiterating it in yellow flowers with their darker green
leaves and underlying shadows. In spring time she may contract its
range, making the blue more green and the yellow less red, but in autumn
she seems to widen the range, presenting strong contrasts of yellow-red
and purple-blue.</p>

<p><a name = "para79" id = "para79">(79)</a>
Every day she plays upon the values of this sequence,
<span class = "pagenum">46</span>
from the strong contrasts of light and shadow at noon to the hardly
perceptible differences at twilight. The chroma of this sequence expands
during the summer to strong colors, and contracts in winter to grays.
Indeed, Nature, who would seem to be the source of our notions of color
harmony, rarely repeats herself, yet is endlessly balancing inequalities
of hue, value, and chroma by compensations of quantity.</p>

<p><a name = "para80" id = "para80">(80)</a>
So subtle is this equilibrium that it is taken for granted and
forgotten, except when some violent disturbance disarranges it, such as
an earthquake or a thunder-storm.</p>

<h5>The triple nature of color balance illustrated.</h5>

<p><a name = "para81" id = "para81">(81)</a>
The simplest idea of balance is the equilibrium of two halves of a stick
supported at its middle point. If one end is heavier than the other, the
support must be moved nearer to that end.</p>

<p>But, since color unites three qualities, we must seek some type of
<i>triple balance</i>. The game of jackstraws illustrates this, when the
disturbance of one piece involves the displacement of two others. The
action of three children on a floating plank or the equilibrium of two
acrobats carried on the shoulders of a third may also serve as
examples.</p>

<p><a name = "para82" id = "para82">(82)</a>

alt = "see text"></a></span>
Triple balance may be graphically shown by three discs in contact. Two
of them are suspended by their centres, while they remain in touch with
a third supported on a pivot, as in Fig. 14. Let us call the lowest disc
Hue (H), and the lateral discs Value (V) and Chroma (C). Any dip or
rotation of the lower disc H will induce sympathetic action in the two
lateral discs V and&nbsp;C. When H is inclined, both V
<span class = "pagenum">47</span>
and C change their relations to it. If H is raised vertically, both V
and C dip outward. If H is rotated, both V and C rotate, but in opposite
directions. Indeed, any disturbance of V affects H and C, while H and V
respond to any movement of&nbsp;C. So we must be prepared to realize
that any change of one color quality involves readjustment of the other
two.</p>

<p><a name = "para83" id = "para83">(83)</a>
Color balance soon leads to a study of optics in one direction, to
æsthetics in another, and to mathematical proportions in a third, and
any attempt at an easy solution of its problems is not likely to
succeed. It is a very complicated question, whose closest counterpart is
to be sought in musical rhythms. The fall of musical impulses upon the
ear can make us gay or sad, and there are color groups which, acting
through the eye, can convey pleasure or pain to the mind.</p>

<p><a name = "para84" id = "para84">(84)</a>
A colorist is keenly alive to these feelings of satisfaction or
annoyance, and consciously or unconsciously he rejects certain
combinations of color and accepts others. Successful pictures and
decorative schemes are due to some sort of balance uniting “light and
shade” (value), “warmth and coolness” (hue), with “brilliancy and
grayness” (chroma); for, when they fail to please, the mind at once
begins to search for the unbalanced quality, and complains that the
color is “too hot,” “too dark,” or “too crude.” This effort to establish
pleasing proportions may be unconscious in one temperament, while it
becomes a matter of definite analysis in another. Emerson claimed that
the unconscious only is complete. We gladly permit those whose color
instinct is unerring&mdash;(and how few they are!)&mdash;to neglect all
rules and set formulas. But education is concerned with the many who
have not this gift.</p>

<p><a name = "para85" id = "para85">(85)</a>
Any real progress in color education must come not from a blind
imitation of past successes, but by a study into the laws
<span class = "pagenum">48</span>
which they exemplify. To exactly copy fine Japanese prints or Persian
rugs or Renaissance tapestries, while it cultivates an appreciation of
their refinements, does not give one the power to create things equally
beautiful. The masterpieces of music correctly rendered do not of
necessity make a composer. The musician, besides the study of
masterpieces, absorbs the science of counterpoint, and records by an
unmistakable notation the exact character of any new combination of
musical intervals which he conceives.</p>

<p><a name = "para86" id = "para86">(86)</a>
So must the art of the colorist be furnished with a scientific basis and
a clear form of color notation. This will record the successes and
failures of the past, and aid in a search, by contrast and analysis, for
the fundamentals of color balance. Without a measured and systematic
notation, attempts to describe color harmony only produce hazy
generalities of little value in describing our sensations, and fail to
express the essential differences between “good” and “bad” color.</p>

<p>all of the hues in the right-hand column being compound sensations.
The sensation of green is not due to a mixture of yellow and blue, as
the absorptive action of pigments might lead one to think: <span class =
"smallroman">GREEN IS FUNDAMENTAL</span>, and not made by mixing any
hues of the spectrum, while <span class = "smallroman">YELLOW IS NOT
FUNDAMENTAL</span>, but caused by the mingled sensations of red and
green. This is easily proved by a controlled spectrum, for all
yellow-reds, yellows, and green-yellows can be matched by certain
proportions of red and green light, all blue-greens, blues, and
purple-blues can be obtained by the union of green and violet light,
while purple-blue, purple, and red-purple result from the union of
violet and red light. But there is no point where a mixture gives red,
green, or violet-blue. They are the true primaries, whose mixtures
produce all other hues.</p>

<p>Studio and school-room practice still cling to the discredited
theory, claiming that, if it fails to describe our color sensations, yet
it may be called practically true of pigments, because a red, yellow,
and blue pigment suffice to imitate most natural colors. This
discrepancy between pigment mixture and retinal mixture becomes clear as
soon as one learns the physical make-up and behavior of paints.</p>

Spectral analysis shows that no pigment is a pure example of the
dominant hue which it sends to the eye. Take, for example, the very
chromatic pigments representing red and green, such as vermilion and
emerald green. If each emitted a single pure hue free from trace of any
other hue, then their mixture would appear yellow, as when spectral red
and green unite. But, instead of yellow, their mixture produces a warm
gray, called brown or “dull salmon,” and this is to be inferred from
their spectra, where it is seen that vermilion emits some green and
purple as well as its dominant color, while the green also sends some
blue and red light to the eye.<a class = "tag" name = "tag20" id =
"tag20" href = "#note20">20</a></p>

<p>Thus stray hues from other parts of the spectrum tend to neutralize
the yellow sensation, which would be strong if each of the pigments were
pure in the spectral sense. Pigment absorption affects all palette
mixtures, and, failing to obtain a satisfactory yellow by mixture of red
and green, painters use original yellow pigments,&mdash;such as
aureolin, cadmium, and lead chromate,&mdash;each of them also impure but
giving a dominant sensation of yellow. Did the eye discriminate, as does
the ear when it analyzes the separate tones of a chord, then we should
recognize that yellow pigments emit both red and green rays.</p>

<p>White light dispersed into a colored band by one prism, may have the
process reversed by a second prism, so that the eye sees again only
white light. But this would not be so, did not the balance of red,
green, and violet-blue sensations remain undisturbed. All our ideas of
color harmony are based upon this fundamental relation, and, if pigments
are to render harmonious effects,
<span class = "pagenum">52</span>
we must learn to control their impurities so as to preserve a balance of
red, green, and violet-blue.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the excessive chroma and value of red and yellow pigments
so overwhelm the lesser degrees of green and blue pigments that no
balance is possible, and the colorist of fine perception must reject not
alone the theoretical, but also the practical outcome of a
“red-yellow-blue” theory.</p>

<p>Some of the points raised in this discussion are rather subtle for
students, and may well be left until they arise in a study of optics,
but the teacher should grasp them clearly, so as not to be led into
false statements about primary and complementary hues.</p>

PRISMATIC COLOR.</h3>


<h5>Pure color is seen in the spectrum of sunlight.</h5>

<p><a name = "para87" id = "para87">(87)</a>
The strongest sensation of color is gained in a darkened room, with a
prism used to split a beam of sunlight into its various wave lengths.
Through a narrow slit there enters a straight pencil of light which we
are accustomed to think of as <i>white</i>, although it is a bundle of
variously colored rays (or waves of ether) whose union and balance is so
perfect that no single ray predominates.</p>

<p><a name = "para88" id = "para88">(88)</a>
<span class = "illustration">
<a name = "fig13" id = "fig13" href = "images/fig13_large.png"
target = "_blank">
<img src = "images/fig13.png" width = "130" height = "111"
alt = "see text"></a></span>
Cover the narrow slit, and we are plunged in darkness. Admit the beam,
and the eye feels a powerful contrast between the spot of light on the
floor and its surrounding darkness. Place a triangular glass prism near
the slit to intercept the beam of white light, and suddenly there
appears on the opposite wall a band of brilliant colors. This delightful
experiment rivets the eye by the beauty and purity of its hues. All
other colors seem weak by comparison.</p>

<p>Their weakness is due to impurity, for all pigments and dyes reflect
portions of hues other than their dominant one, which tend to “gray” and
diminish their chroma.</p>

<p><a name = "para89" id = "para89">(89)</a>
But prismatic color is pure, or very nearly so, because the shape of the
glass refracts each hue, and separates it by the length
<span class = "pagenum">54</span>
of its ether wave. These waves have been measured, and science can name
each hue by its wave length. Thus a certain red is known as M. 6867, and
a certain green sensation is M. 5269.<a class = "tag" name = "tag21" id
= "tag21" href = "#note21">21</a> Without attempting any scientific
analysis of color, let it be said that Sir Isaac Newton made his series
of experiments in 1687, and was privileged to name this color sequence
by seven steps which he called red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet,
and indigo. Later a scientist named Fraunhofer discovered fine black
lines crossing the solar spectrum, and marked them with letters of the
alphabet from a to&nbsp;h. These with the wave length serve to locate
every hue and define every step in the sequence. Since Newton’s time it
has been proved that only three of the spectral hues are <i>primary</i>;
viz., a&nbsp;red, a&nbsp;green, and a violet-blue, while their mixture
produces all other gradations. By receiving the spectrum on an opaque
screen with fine slits that fit the red and green waves, so that they
alone pass through, these two primary hues can be received on mirrors
inclined at such an angle as to unite on another screen, where, instead
of red or green, the eye sees only yellow.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag22" id = "tag22" href = "#note22">22</a></p>

<p><a name = "para90" id = "para90">(90)</a>
A similar arrangement of slits and mirrors for the green and violet-blue
proves that they unite to make blue, while a third experiment shows that
the red and violet-blue can unite to make purple. So yellow, blue-green,
and purple are called secondary
<span class = "pagenum">55</span>
hues because they result from the mixture of the three primaries, red,
green, and violet-blue.</p>

<p>In comparing these two color lists, we see that the “indigo” and
“orange” of Sir Isaac Newton have been discarded. Both are indefinite,
and refer to variable products of the vegetable kingdom. Violet is also
borrowed from the same kingdom; and, in order to describe a violet, we
say it is a purple violet or blue violet, as the case may be, just as we
describe an orange as a red orange or a yellow orange. Their color
difference is not expressed by the terms “orange” or “violet,” but by
the words “red,” “yellow,” “blue,” or “purple,” all of which are true
color names and arouse an unmixed color image.</p>

<p><a name = "para91" id = "para91">(91)</a>
In the nursery a child learns to use the simple color names red, yellow,
green, blue, and purple. When familiarity with the color sphere makes
him relate them to each other and place them between black and white by
their degree of light and strength, there will be no occasion to revert
to vegetables, animals, minerals, or the ever-varying hues of sea and
sky to express his color sensations.</p>

<p><a name = "para92" id = "para92">(92)</a>
Another experiment accentuates the difference between spectral and
pigment color. When the spectrum is spread on the screen by the use of a
prism, and a second prism is placed inverted beyond the first, it
regathers the dispersed rays back into their original beam, making a
white spot on the floor. This proves that all the colored rays of light
combine to balance each other in whiteness. But if pigments which are
the closest possible imitation of these hues are united on a painter’s
palette, either by the brush or the knife, they <i>make gray, and not
white</i>.</p>

<p><a name = "para93" id = "para93">(93)</a>
This is another illustration of the behavior of pigments, for, instead
of uniting to form white, they form gray, which is a
<span class = "pagenum">56</span>
darkened or impure form of white; and, lest this should be attributed to
a chemical reaction between the various matters that serve as pigments,
the experiment can be carried out without allowing one pigment to touch
another by using Maxwell discs, as will be shown in the next
chapter.</p>

<p><a name = "para94" id = "para94">(94)</a>
Before leaving these prismatic colors, let us study them in the light of
what has already been learned of color dimensions. Not only do they
present different values, but also different chromas. Their values range
from darkness at each end, where red and purple become visible, to a
brightness in the greenish yellow, which is almost white. So on the
color tree described in Chapter II., paragraph <a href =
"#para34">34</a>, yellow has the highest branch, green is lower, red is
below the middle, with blue and purple lower down, near black.</p>


<p><a name = "para95" id = "para95">(95)</a>
Then in chroma they range from the powerful stimulation of the red to
the soothing purple, with green occupying an intermediate step. This is
also given on the color tree by the length of its branches.</p>

<p><a name = "para96" id = "para96">(96)</a>

In Fig. 15 the vertical curve describes the values of the spectrum as
they grade from red through yellow, green, blue, and purple. The
horizontal curve describes the chromas of the spectrum in the same
sequence; while the third curve leaning outward is obtained by uniting
the first two by two planes at right angles to one another, and sums up
the three qualities by a single descriptive line. Now the red and purple
ends are far apart, and science forbids their junction because of their
great difference in wave length. But the mind is prone to unite them in
order to produce the red-purples which we see in clouds at sunset, in
flowers and
<span class = "pagenum">57</span>
grapes and the amethyst. Indeed, it has been done unhesitatingly in most
color schemes in order to supply the opposite of green.</p>

<p><a name = "para97" id = "para97">(97)</a>
This gives a slanting circuit joining all the branch ends of the color
tree, and has been likened to the rings of Saturn in Chapter&nbsp;I.,
paragraph&nbsp;<a href = "#para17">17</a>.</p>

<h5>A prismatic color sphere.</h5>

<p><a name = "para98" id = "para98">(98)</a>
With a little effort of the imagination we can picture a prismatic color
sphere, using only the colors of light. In a cylindrical chamber is hung
a diaphanous ball similar to a huge soap bubble, which can display color
on its surface without obscuring its interior. Then, at the proper
points of the surrounding wall, three pure beams of colored light are
admitted,&mdash;one red, another green, and the third violet-blue.</p>

<p><a name = "para99" id = "para99">(99)</a>
They fall at proper levels on three sides of the sphere, while their
intermediate gradations encircle the sphere with a complete spectrum
plus the needed purple. As they penetrate the sphere, they unite to
balance each other in neutrality. Pure whiteness is at the top, and, by
some imaginary means their light gradually diminishes until they
disappear in darkness below.</p>

<p><a name = "para100" id = "para100">(100)</a>
This ideal color system is impossible in the present state of our
knowledge and implements. Even were it possible, its immaterial hues
could not serve to dye materials or paint pictures. Pigments are, and
will in all probability continue to be, the practical agents of
coloristic productions, however reluctant the scientist may be to accept
them as the basis of a color system. It is true that they are chemically
impure and imperfectly represent the colors of light. Some of them fade
rapidly and undergo chemical change, as in the notable case of a green
pigment tested
<span class = "pagenum">58</span>
by this measured system, which in a few weeks lost four steps of chroma,
gained two steps of value, and swung into a bluer hue.</p>

<p><a name = "para101" id = "para101">(101)</a>
But the color sphere to be next described is worked out with a few
reliable pigments, mostly natural earths, whose fading is a matter of
years and so slight as to be almost imperceptible. Besides, its
principal hues are preserved in safe keeping by imperishable enamels,
which can be used to correct any tendency of the pigments to distort the
measured intervals of the color sphere.</p>

<p>This meets the most serious objection to a pigment system. Without it
a child has nothing tangible which he can keep in constant view to
imitate and memorize. With it he builds up a mental image of measured
relations that describe every color in nature, including the fleeting
hues of the rainbow, although they appear but for a moment at rare
intervals. Finally, it furnishes a simple notation which records every
color sensation by a letter and two numerals. With the enlargement of
his mental power he will unite these in a comprehensive grasp of the
larger relations of color.</p>

The fact that the spectral union of red and green makes yellow is a
matter of surprise to practical workers in color who are familiar with
the action of pigments, but unfamiliar with spectrum analysis. Yellow
seems to them a primary and indispensable color, because it cannot be
made by the union of red and green pigments. Another surprise is
awaiting them when they hear that the yellow and blue of the spectrum
make <i>white</i>, for all their experience with paints goes to prove
that yellow and blue unite to form green. Attention is called to this
difference between the mixture of colored light and of colored pigments,
not with the idea of explaining it here, but to emphasize their
difference; for in the next chapter we shall describe the practical
making of a color sphere with pigments, which would be quite
impractical, could we have only the colors of the spectrum to work with.

<h5>Children’s Color Studies.</h5>

<p>These reproductions of children’s work are given as proof that color
charm and good taste may be cultivated from the start.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Five Middle Hues</span> are first taught by
the use of special crayons, and later with water colors. They represent
the equator of the color sphere (see <a href = "#plateI">Plate
I.</a>),&mdash;a circle midway between the extremes of color-light and
color-strength,&mdash;and are known as <span class = "smallcaps">Middle
Red</span>, <span class = "smallcaps">Middle Yellow</span>, <span class
= "smallcaps">Middle Green</span>, <span class = "smallcaps">Middle
Blue</span>, and <span class = "smallcaps">Middle Purple</span>.</p>

<p>These are starting-points for training the eye to measure regular
scales of Value and Chroma.<a class = "tag" name = "tag23" id = "tag23"
href = "#note23">23</a> Only with such a trained judgment is it safe to
undertake the use of strong colors.<a class = "tag" name = "tag24" id =
"tag24" href = "#note24">24</a></p>

<p><i>Beginners should avoid Strong Color.</i> Extreme red, yellow, and
blue are discordant. (They “shriek” and “swear.” Mark Twain calls
Roxana’s gown “a volcanic eruption of infernal splendors.”) Yet there
are some who claim that the child craves them, and must have them to
produce a thrill. So also does he crave candies, matches, and the
carving-knife. He covets the trumpet, fire-gong, and bass-drum for their
“thrill”; but who would think them necessary
<span class = "pagenum">60</span>
to the musical training of the ear? Like the blazing bill-board and the
circus wagon, they may be suffered out-of-doors; but such boisterous
sounds and color sprees are unfit for the school-room.</p>

<p><i>Quiet Color is the Mark of Good Taste.</i> Refinement in dress and
the furnishings of the home is attractive, but we shrink from those who
are “loud” in their speech or their clothing. If we wish our children to
become well-bred, is it logical to begin by encouraging barbarous
tastes? Their young minds are very open to suggestion. They quickly
adopt our standards, and the blame must fall upon us if they acquire
crude color habits. Yellow journalism and rag-time tunes will not help
their taste in speech or song, nor will violent hues improve their taste
in matters of color.</p>

<p><i>Balance of Color is to be sought.</i> Artists and decorators are
well aware of a fact that slowly dawns upon the student; namely, that
color harmony is due to the preservation of a subtle balance and
impossible by the use of extremes. This balance of color resides more
<i>within</i> the spherical surface of this system than in the excessive
chromas which project beyond. It is futile to encourage children in
efforts to rival the poppy or buttercup, even with the strongest
pigments obtainable. Their sunlit points give pleasure because they are
surrounded and balanced by blue ether and wide green fields. Were these
conditions reversed, so that the flowers appeared as little spots of
blue or green in great fields of blazing red, orange, and yellow, our
pained eyes would be shut in disgust.</p>

<p>The painter knows that pigments <i>cannot</i> rival the brilliancy of
the buttercup and poppy, enhanced by their surroundings. What is more,
he does not care to attempt it. Nor does the musician wish to imitate
the screech of a siren or the explosion of a gun. These are not subjects
for art. Harmonious sounds are the study of the musician, and tuned
colors are the materials of the colorist. Corot
<span class = "pagenum">61</span>
in landscape, and Titian, Velasquez, and Whistler in figure painting,
show us that Nature’s richest effects and most beautiful color are
enveloped in an atmosphere of gray.</p>

<p><i>Beauty of Color lies in Tempered Relations.</i> Music rarely
touches the extreme range of sound, and harmonious color rarely uses the
extremes of color-light or color-strength. Regular scales in the middle
register are first given to train the ear, and so should the eye be
first familiarized with medium degrees of color.</p>

<p>This system provides measured scales, established by special
instruments, and is able to select the middle points of red, yellow,
green, blue, and purple as a basis for comparing and relating all
colors. These five middle colors form a Chromatic Tuning Fork. (See page
70.) It is far better that children should first become familiar with
these tuned color intervals which are harmonious in themselves rather
than begin by blundering among unrelated degrees of harsh and violent
color. Who would think of teaching the musical scale with a piano out of
tune?</p>

<p><i>The Tuning of Color cannot be left to Personal Whim.</i> The wide
discrepancies of red, yellow, and blue, which have been falsely taught
as primary colors, can no more be tuned by a child than the musical
novice can tune his instrument. Each of these hues has three variable
factors (see page 14, paragraph <a href = "#para14">14</a>), and
scientific tests are necessary to measure and relate their uneven
degrees of Hue, Value, and Chroma.</p>

<p>Visual estimates of color, without the help of any standard for
comparison, are continually distorted by doubt, guess-work, and the
fatigue of the eye. Hardly two persons can agree in the intelligible
description of color. Not only do individuals differ, but the same eye
will vary in its estimates from day to day. A&nbsp;frequent assumption
that all strong pigments are equal in chroma, is
<span class = "pagenum">62</span>
far from the truth, and involves beginners in many mishaps. Thus the
strongest blue-green, chromium sesquioxide, is but half the chroma of
its red complement, the sulphuret of mercury. Yet ignorance is
constantly leading to their unbalanced use. Indeed, some are still
unaware that they are the complements of each other.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag25" id = "tag25" href = "#note25">25</a></p>

<p>It is evident that the fundamental scales of Hue, Value, and Chroma
must be established by scientific measures, not by personal bias. This
system is unique in the possession of such scales, made possible by the
devising of special instruments for the measurement of color, and can
therefore be trusted as a permanent basis for training the color
sense.</p>

<p>The examples in Plates II. and III. show how successfully the tuned
crayons, cards, and water colors of this system lead a child to fine
appreciations of color harmony.</p>

<p>Children have made every example on this plate, with no other
material than the five crayons of middle hue, tempered with gray and
black. A&nbsp;Color Sphere is always kept in the room for reference, and
five color balls to match the five middle hues are placed in the hands
of the youngest pupils. Starting with these middle points in the scales
of Value and Chroma, they learn to estimate rightly all lighter and
darker values, all weaker and stronger chromas, and gradually build up a
disciplined judgment of color.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">63</span>
<p>Each study can be made the basis of many variations by a simple
change of one color element, as suggested in the text.</p>

touches of any two neighbors, the intermediates are made and named
yellow-red (orange), green-yellow, blue-green, purple-blue (violet), and
red-purple. Abbreviated, the circle reads R, YR, Y, GY, G, BG, B, PB,

<h4>PLATE III.<br>
Color Studies with TUNED WATER COLORS<br>
in the Upper Grades.</h4>

<p>Previous work with measured scales, made by the tuned crayons and
tested by reference to the color sphere, have so trained the color
judgment that children may now be trusted with more flexible material.
They have memorized the equable degrees of color on the equator of the
sphere, and found how lighter colors may balance darker colors, how
small areas of stronger chroma may be balanced by larger masses of
weaker chroma, and in general gained a disciplined color sense. Definite
impressions and clear thinking have taken the place of guess-work and
blundering.</p>

<p>Thus, before reaching the secondary school, they are put in
possession of the color faculty by a system and notation similar to that
which was devised centuries ago for the musical sense. No system,
however logical, will produce the artist, but every artist needs some
systematic training at the outset, and this simple method by measured
scales is believed to be the best yet devised.</p>

<p>Each example on this plate may be made the basis of many variants, by
small changes in the color steps, as suggested in the
<span class = "pagenum">65</span>

Indeed, the studies reproduced on Plates II. and III. are but a handful
among hundreds of pleasing results produced in a single school.<a class

The preceding chapters have built up an ideal color solid, in which
every sensation of color finds its place and is clearly named by its
degree of hue, value, and chroma.</p>

<p>It has been shown that the neutral centre of the system is a
balancing point for all colors, that a line through this centre finds
opposite colors which balance and complement each other; and we are now
ready to make a practical application, carrying out these ideal
relations of color as far as pigments will permit in a color sphere<a
class = "tag" href = "#note27">27</a> (Fig.&nbsp;16).</p>

<p><a name = "para103" id = "para103">(103)</a>
The materials are quite simple. First a colorless globe, mounted so as
to spin freely on its axis. Then a measured scale of value, specially
devised for this purpose, obtained by the daylight photometer.<a class =
"tag" name = "tag28" id = "tag28" href = "#note28">28</a> Next a set of
carefully chosen pigments, whose reasonable permanence has been tested
by long use, and which are prepared so that they will not glisten when
spread on the surface of the globe, but give a uniformly mat surface.
A&nbsp;glass palette, palette knife, and some fine brushes complete the
list.</p>

These paints have various degrees of hue, value, and chroma, but can be
tempered by additions of the neutrals, zinc white and ivory black, until
each is brought to a middle value and tested on the value scale. After
each pair has been thus balanced, they are painted in their appropriate
spaces on the globe, forming an equator of balanced hues.</p>

<p><a name = "para106" id = "para106">(106)</a>
<span class = "illustration">
<a name = "fig17" id = "fig17" href = "images/fig17_large.png"
target = "_blank">
<img src = "images/fig17.png" width = "104" height = "95"
alt = "see text"></a></span>
The method of proving this balance has already been suggested in Chapter
IV., paragraph <a href = "#para93">93</a>. It consists of an ingenious
implement devised by Clerk-Maxwell, which gives us a result of mixing
colors without the chemical risks of letting them come in contact, and
also measures accurately the quantity of each which is used
(Fig.&nbsp;17).</p>

<p><a name = "para107" id = "para107">(107)</a>
This is called a Maxwell disc, and is nothing more than
<span class = "pagenum">68</span>
a circle of firm cardboard, pierced with a central hole to fit the
spindle of a rotary motor, and with a radial slit from rim to centre, so
that another disc may be slid over the first to cover any desired
fraction of its surface. Let us paint one of these discs with Venetian
red and the other with viridian and cobalt, the first pair in the list
of pigments to be used on the globe.</p>

<p><a name = "para108" id = "para108">(108)</a>
Having dried these two discs, one is combined with the other on the
motor shaft so that each color occupies half the circle. As soon as the
motor starts, the two colors are no longer distinguished, and rapid
rotation melts them so perfectly that the eye sees a new color, due to
their mixture on the retina. This new color is a reddish gray, showing
that the red is more chromatic than the blue-green. But by stopping the
motor and sliding the green disc to cover more of the red one, there
comes a point where rotation melts them into a perfectly neutral gray.
No hint of either hue remains, and the pair is said to balance.</p>

<p><a name = "para109" id = "para109">(109)</a>
Since this balance has been obtained by <i>unequal areas</i> of the two
pigments, it must compensate for a lack of equal chroma in the hues (see
paragraphs <a href = "#para76">76, 77</a>); and, to measure this
inequality, a&nbsp;slightly larger disc, with decimal divisions on its
rim, is placed back of the two painted ones. If this scale shows the red
as occupying 3⅓ parts of the area, while blue-green occupies 6⅔ parts,
then the blue-green must be only half as chromatic as the red, since it
takes twice as much to produce the balance.</p>

<p><a name = "para110" id = "para110">(110)</a>
The red is then grayed (diminished in chroma by additions of a middle
gray) until it can occupy half the circle, with blue-green on the
remaining half, and still produce neutrality when mixed by rotation.
Each disc now reads 5 on the decimal scale. Lest the graying of red
should have disturbed its value, it is again tested on the photometric
scale, and reads 4.7, showing it has been
<span class = "pagenum">69</span>
slightly darkened by the graying process. A&nbsp;little white is
therefore added until its value is restored to&nbsp;5.</p>

<p><a name = "para111" id = "para111">(111)</a>
The two opposites are now completely balanced, for they are equal in
value (5), equal in chroma (5), and have proved their equality as
complements by uniting in equal areas to form a neutral mixture. It only
remains to apply them in their proper position on the sphere.</p>

<p><a name = "para112" id = "para112">(112)</a>
A band is traced around the equator, divided in ten equal spaces, and
lettered R, YR, Y, GY, G, BG, B, PB, P, and RP (see Fig. 18). This
balanced red and blue-green are applied with the brush to spaces marked
R and BG, care being taken to fill, but not to overstep the bounds, and
the color laid absolutely flat, that no unevenness of value or chroma
may disturb the balance.</p>

<p><a name = "para113" id = "para113">(113)</a>
<span class = "illustration">
<a name = "fig18" id = "fig18" href = "images/fig18_large.png"
target = "_blank">
<img src = "images/fig18.png" width = "101" height = "103"
alt = "see text"></a></span>
The next pair, represented by Raw Sienna and Ultramarine, is similarly
brought to middle value, balanced by equal areas on the Maxwell discs,
and, when correct in each quality, is painted in the spaces Y and PB.
Emerald Green and Purple Madder, which form the next pigment pair, are
similarly tempered, proved, and applied, followed by the two remaining
pairs, until the equator of the globe presents its ten equal steps of
middle hues.</p>

<h5>An equator of ten balanced hues.</h5>

<p><a name = "para114" id = "para114">(114)</a>
Now comes the total test of this circuit of balanced hues by rotation of
the sphere. As it gains speed, the colors flash less and less, and
finally melt into a middle gray of perfect neutrality. Had it failed to
produce this gray and shown a tinge of any hue still persisting, we
should say that the persistent hue was in excess, or, conversely, that
its opposite hue was deficient in chroma, and failed to preserve its
share in the balance.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">70</span>
<p><a name = "para115" id = "para115">(115)</a>
For instance, had rotation discovered the persistence of reddish gray,
it would have proved the red too strong, or its opposite, blue-green,
too weak, and we should have been forced to retrace our steps, applying
a correction until neutrality was established by the rotation test.</p>

<p><a name = "para116" id = "para116">(116)</a>
This is the practical demonstration of the assertion (Chapter&nbsp;I.,
paragraph&nbsp;<a href = "#para8">8</a>) that a <i>color has three
dimensions which can be measured</i>. Each of these ten middle hues has
proved its right to a definite place on the color globe by its
measurements of value and chroma. Being of equal chroma, all are
equidistant from the neutral centre, and, being equal in value, all are
equally removed from the poles. If the warm hues (red and yellow) or the
cool hues (blue and green) were in excess, the rotation test of the
sphere would fail to produce grayness, and so detect its lack of
balance.<a class = "tag" name = "tag29" id = "tag29" href =
"#note29">29</a></p>

<h5>A chromatic tuning fork.</h5>

<p><a name = "para117" id = "para117">(117)</a>
The five principal steps in this color equator are made in permanent
enamel and carefully safeguarded, so that, if the pigments painted on
the globe should change or become soiled, it could be at once detected
and set right. These five are middle red (so called because midway
between white and black, as well as midway between our strongest red and
the neutral centre), middle yellow, middle green, middle blue, and
middle purple. They may be called the <span class =
"smallroman">CHROMATIC TUNING FORK</span>, for they serve to establish
the pitch of colors, as the musical tuning fork preserves the pitch of
sounds.</p>

<h5>Completion of a pigment color sphere.</h5>

<p><a name = "para118" id = "para118">(118)</a>
When the chromatic tuning fork has thus been obtained,
<span class = "pagenum">71</span>
the completion of the globe is only a matter of patience, for the same
method can be applied at any level in the scale of value, and a new
circuit of balanced hues made to conform with its position between the
poles of white and black.</p>

<p><a name = "para119" id = "para119">(119)</a>
<span class = "illustration">
<a name = "fig19" id = "fig19" href = "images/fig19_large.png"
target = "_blank">
<img src = "images/fig19.png" width = "108" height = "94"
alt = "see text"></a></span>
The surface above and below the equatorial band is set off by parallels
to match the photometric scale, making nine bands or value zones in all,
of which the equator is fifth, the black pole being 0 and the white
pole&nbsp;10.</p>

<p><a name = "para120" id = "para120">(120)</a>
Ten meridians carry the equatorial hues across all these value zones and
trace the gradation of each hue through a complete scale from black to
white, marked by their values, as shown in paragraph <a href =
"#para68">68</a>. Thus the red scale is R<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>2</sup>,
R<sup>3</sup>, R<sup>4</sup>, R<sup>5</sup> (middle red), R<sup>6</sup>,
R<sup>7</sup>, R<sup>8</sup>, and R<sup>9</sup>, and similarly with each
of the other hues. When the circle of hues corresponding to each level
has been applied and tested, the entire surface of the globe is spread
with a logical system of color scales, and the eye gratified with
regular sequences which move by measured steps in each direction.</p>

<p><a name = "para121" id = "para121">(121)</a>
Each meridian traces a scale of value for the hue in which it lies. Each
parallel traces a scale of hue for the value at whose level it is drawn.
Any oblique path across these scales traces a regular sequence, each
step combining change of hue with a change of value and chroma. The more
this path approaches the vertical, the less are its changes of hue and
the more its changes of value and chroma; while, the nearer it comes to
the horizontal, the less are its changes of value and chroma, while the
greater become its changes of hue. Of these two oblique paths the first
may be called that of a Luminist, or painter like Rembrandt, whose
canvases present great contrasts of light and shade, while the second
<span class = "pagenum">72</span>
is that of the Colorist, such as Titian, whose work shows great fulness
of hues without the violent extremes of white and black.</p>

<h5>Total balance of the sphere tested by rotation on any desired
axis.</h5>

<p><a name = "para122" id = "para122">(122)</a>
Not only does the mount of the color sphere permit its rotation on the
vertical axis (white-black), but it is so hung that it may be spun on
the ends of any desired axis, as, for instance, that joining our first
color pair, red and blue-green. With this pair as poles of rotation,
a&nbsp;new equator is traced through all the values of purple on one
side and of green-yellow on the other, which the rotation test melts in
a perfect balance of middle gray, proving the correctness of these
values. In the same way it may be hung and tested on successive axes,
until the total balance of the entire spherical series is proved.</p>

<p><a name = "para123" id = "para123">(123)</a>
But this color system does not cease with the colors spread on the
surface of a globe.<a class = "tag" name = "tag30" id = "tag30" href =
"#note30">30</a> The first illustration of an orange filled with color
was chosen for the purpose of stimulating the imagination to follow a
surface color inward to the neutral axis by regular decrease of chroma.
A&nbsp;slice at any level of the solid, as at value 8 (<a href =
"#fig10">Fig. 10</a>), shows each hue of that level passing by even
steps of increasing grayness to the neutral gray N<sup>8</sup> of the
axis. In the case of red at this level, it is easily described by the
notation R<sup>8</sup>/<sub>3</sub>, R<sup>8</sup>/<sub>2</sub>,
R<sup>8</sup>/<sub>1</sub>, of which the initial and upper numerals do
not change, but the lower numeral traces loss of chroma by 3, 2, and 1
to the neutral axis.</p>

<p><a name = "para124" id = "para124">(124)</a>
And there are stronger chromas of red outside the surface, which can be
written R<sup>8</sup>/<sub>4</sub>, R<sup>8</sup>/<sub>5</sub>,
R<sup>8</sup>/<sub>6</sub>, etc. Indeed, our color measurements discover
such differences of chroma in the various pigments used, that the color
tree referred to in paragraphs <a href = "#para34">34, 35</a>, is
necessary
<span class = "pagenum">73</span>
to bring before the eye their maximum chromas, most of which are well
outside the spherical shell and at various levels of value. One way to
describe the color sphere is to suggest that a color tree, the intervals
between whose irregular branches are filled with appropriate color, can
be placed in a turning lathe and turned down until the color maxima are
removed, thus producing a color solid no larger than the chroma of its
weakest pigment (<a href = "#fig2">Fig.&nbsp;2</a>).</p>

<h5>Charts of the color solid.</h5>

<p><a name = "para125" id = "para125">(125)</a>
Thus it becomes evident that, while the color sphere is a valuable help
to the child in conceiving color relations, in uniting the three scales
of color measure, and in furnishing with its mount an excellent test of
the theory of color balance, yet it is always restricted to the chroma
of its weakest color, the surplus chromas of all other colors being
thought of as enormous mountains built out at various levels to reach
the maxima of our pigments.</p>

<p><a name = "para126" id = "para126">(126)</a>
The complete color solid is, therefore, of irregular shape, with
mountains and valleys, corresponding to the inequalities of pigments. To
display these inequalities to the eye, we must prepare cross sections or
charts of the solid, some horizontal, some vertical, and others
oblique.</p>

<p><a name = "para127" id = "para127">(127)</a>
Such a set of charts forms an atlas of the color solid, enabling one to
see any color in its relation to all other colors, and name it by its
degree of hue, value, and chroma. Fig. 20 is a horizontal chart of all
colors which present middle value (5), and describes by an uneven
contour the chroma of every hue at this level. The dotted fifth circle
is the equator of the color sphere, whose principal hues,
R<sup>5</sup>/<sub>5</sub>. Y<sup>5</sup>/<sub>5</sub>,
G<sup>5</sup>/<sub>5</sub>, B<sup>5</sup>/<sub>5</sub>, and
P<sup>5</sup>/<sub>5</sub>, form the chromatic tuning fork, paragraph <a
href = "#para117">117</a>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">74</span>
<p class = "illustration">
<a href = "images/fig20_large.png" target = "_blank">

title = "Chart of Middle Value 5 / Showing Unequal Chroma in circle of Hues"></a>

<p><a name = "para128" id = "para128">(128)</a>
In this single chart the eye readily distinguishes some three hundred
different colors, each of which may be written by its hue, value, and
chroma. And even the slightest variation of one of them can be defined.
Thus, if the principal red were to fade slightly, so that it was a
trifle lighter and a trifle weaker than the enamel, it would be written
R<sup>5.1</sup>/<sub>4.9</sub>, showing it had lightened by 1 per cent.
and weakened by 1 per cent. The discrimination made possible by this
decimal notation is much finer than our present visual limit. Its use
will stimulate finer perception of color.</p>

<p><a name = "para129" id = "para129">(129)</a>
Such a very elementary sketch of the Color Solid and Color Atlas, which
is all that can be given in the confines of this small book, will be
elsewhere presented on a larger and more complete scale. It should be
contrasted with the ideal form composed of prismatic colors, suggested
in the last chapter, paragraphs
<span class = "pagenum">75</span>
<a href = "#para98">98, 99</a>, which was shown to be impracticable, but
whose ideal conditions it follows as far as the limitations of pigments
permit.</p>

<p><a name = "para130" id = "para130">(130)</a>
Besides its value in education as setting all our color notions in
order, and supplying a simple method for their clear expression, it
promises to do away with much of the misunderstanding that accompanies
the every-day use of color.</p>

Popular color names are incongruous, irrational, and often ludicrous.

<p>The advantage of spacing these 25 colors in 13 groups, some with
three and others with but one example, is not apparent; nor why
ultramarine should be several steps above turquoise, for the reverse is
generally true. Besides which the hue of turquoise is greenish, while
that of ultramarine is purplish, but the list cannot show this; and the
remarkable statement that one kind of blue is “hellish,” while another
is “celestial,” should rest upon an experience that few can claim.
Failing to define color-value and color-hue, the list gives no hint of
color-strength, except at
<span class = "pagenum">76</span>
C and D, where one kind of blue is “dying” when the next is “being
born,” which not inaptly describes the color memory of many a person.
Finally, it assures us that Queen blue is “fine” and King blue is
“deep.”</p>

<p>This year the fashionable shades are “burnt onion” and “fresh
spinach.” The florists talk of a “pink violet” and a “green pink.”
A&nbsp;maker of inks describes the red as a “true crimson scarlet,”
which is a contradiction in terms. These and a host of other names
borrowed from the most heterogeneous sources, become outlawed as soon as
the simple color terms and measures of this system are adopted.</p>

<p>Runge, of Hamburg (1810), suggested that red, yellow, and blue be
placed equidistant around the equator of a sphere, with white and black
at opposite poles. As the yellow was very light and the blue very dark,
any coherency in the value scales of red, yellow, and blue was
impossible.</p>

<p>Chevreul, of Paris (1861), seeking uniform color scales for his
workmen at the Gobelins, devised a hollow cylinder built up of ten color
circles. The upper circle had red, yellow, and blue spaced equidistant,
and, as in Runge’s solid, yellow was very light and blue very dark. Each
circle was then made “one-tenth” darker than the next above, until black
was reached at the base. Although each circle was supposed to lie
horizontally, only the black lowest circle presents a level of uniform
values.</p>

<p>Yellow values increase their luminosity thrice as fast as purple
values, so that each circle should tilt at an increasing angle, and the
upper circle of strongest colors be inclined at 60° to the black base.
Besides this fault shared with Runge’s sphere, it falls into another by
not diminishing the size of the lower circles where added black
diminishes the chroma.</p>

<p>Desire to make colors fit a chosen contour, and the absence of
<span class = "pagenum">78</span>
measuring instruments, cause these schemes to ignore the facts of color
relation. Like ancient maps made to satisfy a conqueror, they amuse by
their distortion.</p>

<p>Brewster’s mistaken theory underlies these schemes, as is also the
case with Froebel’s gifts, whose color balls continue to give wrong
notions at the very threshold of color education. As pointed out in the
<a href = "#appIII">Appendix to Chapter III.</a>, the “red-yellow-blue”
theory inevitably spreads the warm field of yellow-red too far, and
contracts the blue field, so that balance of color is rendered
impossible, as illustrated in the gaudy chromo and flaming
bill-board.</p>

<p>These schemes are criticised by Rood as “not only in the main
arbitrary, but also vague”; and, although Chevreul’s charts were
published by the government in most elaborate form, their usefulness is
small. Interest in the growth of the present system, because of its
measured character, led Professor Rood to give assistance in the tests,
and at his request a color sphere was made for the Physical Cabinet at
Columbia.</p>

<h5>Suggestion of a chromatic score.</h5>

<p><a name = "para132" id = "para132">(132)</a>
The last chapter traced a series of steps leading to the construction of
a practical color sphere. Each color was tested by appropriate
instruments to assure its degree of hue, value, and chroma, before being
placed in position. Then the total sphere was tested to detect any lack
of balance.</p>

<p><a name = "para133" id = "para133">(133)</a>
Each color was also <i>written</i> by a letter and two numerals, showing
its place in the three scales of hue, value, and chroma. This naturally
suggests, not only a record of each separate color sensation, but also a
union of these records in series and groups to form a <i>color
score</i>, similar to the musical score by which the measured relations
of sound are recorded.</p>

A very simple form of color score may be easily imagined as a
transparent envelope wrapped around the equator of the sphere, and
forming a vertical cylinder (Fig. 21). On the envelope the equator
traces a horizontal centre line, which is at 5 of the <i>value
scale</i>, with zones 6, 7, 8, and 9 as parallels above, and the zones
4, 3, 2, and 1 below. Vertical lines are drawn through ten equidistant
points on this centre line, corresponding with the divisions of the
<i>hue scale</i>, and marked R, YR, Y, GY, G, BG, B, PB, P,
and&nbsp;RP.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">80</span>
<p><a name = "para135" id = "para135">(135)</a>
The transparent envelope is thus divided into one hundred compartments,
which provide for ten steps of value in each of the ten middle colors.
Now, if we cut open this envelope along one of the verticals,&mdash;as,
for instance, red-purple (RP), it may be spread out, making a flat chart
of the color sphere (Fig.&nbsp;22).</p>

<h5>Why green is given the centre of the score.</h5>

<p><a name = "para136" id = "para136">(136)</a>

alt = "see text"></a></span>
A cylindrical envelope might be opened on any desired meridian, but it
is an advantage to have green (G) at the centre of the chart, and it is
therefore opened at the opposite point, red-purple (RP). To the right of
the green centre are the meridians of green-yellow (GY), yellow (Y),
yellow-red (YR), and red (R), all of which are known as <i>warm
colors</i>, because they contain yellow and red. To the left are the
meridians of blue-green (BG), blue (B), purple-blue (PB), and purple
(P), all of which are called <i>cool colors</i>, because they contain
blue. Green, being neither warm nor cold of itself, and becoming so only
by additions of yellow or of blue, thus serves as a balancing point or
centre in the hue-scale.<a class = "tag" name = "tag31" id = "tag31"
href = "#note31">31</a></p>

<p><a name = "para137" id = "para137">(137)</a>
The color score presents four large divisions or color fields made by
the intersection of the equator with the meridian of green. Above the
centre are all light colors, and below it are all dark colors. To the
right of the centre are all warm colors, and to the left are all cool
colors. Middle green (5G<sup>5</sup>/<sub>5</sub>) is the centre of
balance for these contrasted qualities, recognized by all
<span class = "pagenum">81</span>
practical color workers. The chart forms a rectangle whose length equals
the equator of the color sphere and its height equals the axis
(a&nbsp;proportion of 3.14:1), representing a union and balance of the
scales of hue and of value. This provides for two color dimensions; but,
to be complete, the chart must provide for the third dimension,
chroma.</p>

<p><a name = "para138" id = "para138">(138)</a>
Replacing the chart around the sphere and joining its ends, so that it
re-forms the transparent envelope, we may thrust a pin through at any
point until it pierces the surface of the sphere. Indeed, the pin can be
thrust deeper until it reaches the neutral axis, thus forming a scale of
chroma for the color point where it enters (see paragraph <a href =
"#para12">12</a>). In the same way any colors on the sphere, within the
sphere, or without it, can have pins thrust into the chart to mark their
place, and the length by which each pin projects can be taken as a
measure of chroma. If the chart is now unrolled, it retains the pins,
which by their place describe the hue and value of a color, while their
length describes its chroma.</p>

<h5>Pins stuck into the score represent chroma.</h5>

<p><a name = "para139" id = "para139">(139)</a>
With this idea of the third color dimension incorporated in the score we
can discard the pin, and record its length by a numeral. Any dot placed
on the score marks a certain degree of hue and value, while a numeral
beside it marks the degree of chroma which it carries, uniting with the
hue and value of that point to give us a certain color. Glancing over a
series of such color points, the eye easily grasps their individual
character, and connects them into an intelligible series.</p>

<p><a name = "para140" id = "para140">(140)</a>
Thus a flat chart becomes the projection of the color solid, and any
color in that solid is transferred to the surface of the chart,
retaining its degrees of hue, value, and chroma. So far the scales have
been spoken of as divided into ten steps, but
<span class = "pagenum">82</span>
they may be subdivided much finer, if desired, by use of the decimal
point. It is a question of convenience whether to make a small score
with only the large divisions, or a much larger score with a hundred
times as many steps. In the latter case each hue has ten steps, the
middle step of green being distinguished as 5G<sup>5</sup>/<sub>5</sub>
to suggest the four steps 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, which precede it, and 6G, 7G,
8G, and 9G, which follow it toward blue-green.</p>

<h5>The score preserves color records in a convenient shape.</h5>

<p>Such a color score, or notation diagram, to be made small or large as
the case demands, offers a very convenient means for recording color
combinations, when pigments are not at hand.</p>

To display its three dimensions, a little model can be made with three
visiting cards, so placed as to present their mutual intersection at
right angles (Fig.&nbsp;24).</p>

<p>5G <sup>5</sup>/<sub>5</sub> is their centre of mutual balance.
A&nbsp;central plane separates all colors into two contrasted fields. To
the right are all warm colors, to the left are all cool colors. Each of
these
<span class = "pagenum">83</span>
fields is again divided by the plane of the equator into lighter colors
above and darker colors below. These four color fields are again
subdivided by a transverse plane through 5G<sup>5</sup>/<sub>5</sub>
into strong colors in front and weak colors beyond or
behind&nbsp;it.</p>

<p><a name = "para142" id = "para142">(142)</a>
Any color group, whose record must all be written to the right of the
centre, is warm, because red and yellow are dominant. One to the left of
the centre must be cool, because it is dominated by blue. A&nbsp;group
written all above the centre must have light in excess, while one
written entirely below is dark to excess. Finally, a&nbsp;score written
all in front of the centre represents only strong chromas, while one
written behind it contains only weak chromas. From this we gather that a
balanced composition of color preserves some sort of equilibrium,
uniting degrees of warm and cool, of light and dark, and of weak and
strong, which is made at once apparent by the dots on the score.</p>

<p><a name = "para143" id = "para143">(143)</a>
A single color, like that of a violet, a&nbsp;rose, or a buttercup,
appears as a dot on the score, with a numeral added for its chroma.
A&nbsp;parti-colored flower, such as a nasturtium, is shown by two dots
with their chromas, and a bunch of red and yellow flowers will give by
their dots a color passage, or “silhouette,” whose warmth and lightness
is unmistakable.</p>

<p>The chroma of each flower written with the silhouette completes the
record. The hues of a beautiful Persian rug, with dark red
predominating, or a verdure tapestry, in which green is dominant, or a
Japanese print, with blue dominant, will trace upon the score a pattern
descriptive of its color qualities. These records, with practice, become
as significant to the eye as the musical score. The general character of
a color combination is apparent at a glance, while its degrees of chroma
are readily joined to fill out the mental image.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">84</span>
<p><a name = "para144" id = "para144">(144)</a>
Such a plan of color notation grows naturally from the spherical system
of measured colors. It is hardly to be hoped, in devising a color score,
that it should not seem crude at first. But the measures forming the
basis of this record can be verified by impartial instruments, and have
a permanent value in the general study of color. They also afford some
definite data as to personal bias in color estimates.</p>

<p><a name = "para145" id = "para145">(145)</a>
This makes it possible to collect in a convenient form two contrasting
and valuable records, one preserving such effects of color as are
generally called pleasing, and another of such groups as are found
unpleasant to the eye. Out of such material something may be gained,
more reliable than the shifting, personal, and contradictory statements
about color harmony now prevalent.</p>

<p class = "footnote">
<a name = "note31" id = "note31" href = "#tag31">31.</a>
To put this in terms of the spectrum wave lengths, long waves at the red
end of the spectrum give the sensation of warmth, while short waves at
the violet end cause the sensation of coolness. Midway between these
extremes is the wave length of green.</p>

COLOR HARMONY.</h3>


<h5>Colors may be grouped to please or to give annoyance.</h5>

<p><a name = "para146" id = "para146">(146)</a>
Attempts to define the laws of harmonious color have not attained marked
success, and the cause is not far to seek. The very sensations
underlying these effects of concord or of discord are themselves
undefined. The misleading formula of my student days&mdash;that three
parts of yellow, five parts of red, and eight parts of blue would
combine harmoniously&mdash;was unable to define the <i>kind</i> of red,
yellow, and blue intended; that is, the hue, value, and chroma of each
of these colors was unknown, and the formula meant a different thing to
each person who tried to use&nbsp;it.</p>

<p><a name = "para147" id = "para147">(147)</a>
It is true that a certain red, green, and blue can be united in such
proportions on Maxwell discs as to balance in a neutral gray; but the
slightest change in either the hue, value, or chroma, of any one of
them, upsets the balance. A&nbsp;new proportion is then needed to regain
the neutral mixture. This has already been shown in the discussion of
triple balance (paragraph&nbsp;<a href = "#para82">82</a>).</p>

<p><a name = "para148" id = "para148">(148)</a>
Harmony of color has been still further complicated by the use of terms
that belong to musical harmony. Now music is a <i>measured art</i>, and
has found a set of intervals which are defined scientifically. The two
arts have many points of similarity; and the impulses of sound waves on
the ear, like those of light waves on the eye, are measured vibrations.
But they are far apart in their scales, and differ so much in important
<span class = "pagenum">86</span>
particulars that no practical relationship can be set up. The intervals
of color sensation require fit names and measures, ere their infinite
variety can be organized into a fixed system.</p>

<p><a name = "para149" id = "para149">(149)</a>
Any effort to compare certain sounds to certain colors soon leads to the
wildest vagaries.</p>

<h5>Harmony of sound is unlike harmony of color.</h5>

<p><a name = "para150" id = "para150">(150)</a>
The poverty of color language tempts to a borrowing from the richer
terminology of music. Musical terms, such as “pitch, key, note, tone,
chord, modulation, nocturne, and symphony,” are frequently used in the
description of color, serving by association to convey certain vague
ideas.</p>

<p><a name = "para151" id = "para151">(151)</a>
In the same way the term <i>color harmony</i>, from association with
musical harmony, presents to the mind an image of color
arrangement,&mdash;varied, yet well proportioned, grouped in orderly
fashion, and agreeable to the eye. But any attempt to define this image
in terms of color is disappointing. Here is a beautiful Persian rug: why
do we call it beautiful? One says “because its colors are <i>rich</i>.”
Why are they rich? “Because they are <i>deep in tone</i>.” What does
that mean? The double-bass and the fog-horn are <i>deep</i> in tone, but
not necessarily beautiful on that account. “Oh, no,” says another, “it
is all in <i>one harmonious key</i>.” But what is a key of color? Is it
made by all the values of one color, such as red, or by all the hues of
equal value, such as the middle hues in our color solid?</p>

<p><a name = "para152" id = "para152">(152)</a>
Certainly it is neither, for the rug has both light and dark colors;
and, of the reds, yellows, greens, and blues, some are stronger and
others weaker. Then what do we mean by a key of color? One must either
continue to flounder about or frankly confess ignorance.</p>

<p><a name = "para153" id = "para153">(153)</a>
Musical harmony explains itself in clear language. It
<span class = "pagenum">87</span>
is illustrated by fixed and definite sound intervals, whose measured
relations form the basis of musical composition. Each key has an
unmistakable character, and the written score presents a statement that
means practically the same thing to every person of musical
intelligence. But the adequate terms of color harmony are yet to be
worked out.</p>

<p>Let us leave these musical analogies, retaining only the clue that
<i>a measured and orderly relation underlies the idea of harmony</i>.
The color solid which has been the subject of these pages is built upon
measured color relations. It unites measured scales of hue, value, and
chroma, and gives a definite color name to every sensation from the
maxima of color-light and color-strength to their disappearance in
darkness.</p>

<p><a name = "para154" id = "para154">(154)</a>
Must not this theoretical color solid, therefore, locate all the
elements which combine to produce color harmony or color discord?<a

Instead of theorizing, let us experiment. As a child at the piano, who
first strikes random and widely separated notes, but soon seeks for the
intervals of a familiar air, so let us, after roaming over the color
globe and its charts, select one familiar color, and study what others
will combine with it to please the eye.</p>

<p><a name = "para156" id = "para156">(156)</a>
Here is a grayish green stuff for a dress, and the little girl who is to
wear it asks what other colors she may use with it. First let us find it
on our instrument, so as to realize its relation to other degrees of
color. Its value is 6,&mdash;one step above the equator of middle value.
Its hue is green, G, and its chroma&nbsp;5. It is written
G<sup>6</sup>/<sub>5</sub>.</p>

<p><a name = "para157" id = "para157">(157)</a>
Color paths lead out from this point in every direction.
<span class = "pagenum">88</span>
Where shall we find harmonious colors, where discordant, where those
paths most frequently travelled? Are there new ones still to be
explored?</p>

<p><a name = "para158" id = "para158">(158)</a>
<i>There are three typical paths: one vertical</i>, with rapid change of
value; <i>another lateral</i>, with rapid change of hue; and a <i>third
inward</i>, through the neutral centre to seek the opposite color field.
All other paths are combinations of two or three of these typical
directions in the color solid.</p>

<h5>Three typical color paths.</h5>

<p><a name = "para159" id = "para159">(159)</a>
<span class = "illustration">
<a name = "fig25" id = "fig25" href = "images/fig25_large.png"
target = "_blank">
<img src = "images/fig25.png" width = "104" height = "105"
alt = "see text"></a></span>
1. The vertical path finds only lighter and darker values of
gray-green,&mdash;“self-colors or shades,” they are generally
called,&mdash;and offers a safe path, even for those deficient in color
sensation, avoiding all complications of hue, and leaving the eye free
to estimate different degrees of a single
quality,&mdash;color-light.</p>

<p><a name = "para160" id = "para160">(160)</a>
2. The lateral path passes through neighboring hues on either side. In
this case it is a sequence from blue, through green into yellow. This is
simply change of hue, without change of value or chroma if the path be
level, but, by inclining it, one end of the sequence becomes lighter,
while the other end darkens. It thus becomes an intermediate between the
first and second typical paths, combining, at each step, a&nbsp;change
of hue with a change of value. This is more complicated, but also more
interesting, showing how the character of the gray-green dress will be
set off by a <i>lighter</i> hat of Leghorn straw, and further improved
by a trimming of <i>darker</i> blue-green. The sequence can be made
still more subtle and attractive by choosing a straw whose yellow is
<i>stronger</i> than the green of the dress, while a <i>weaker</i>
<span class = "pagenum">89</span>
chroma of blue-green is used in the trimming. This is clearly expressed
by the notation thus: Y<sup>8</sup>/<sub>7</sub>,
G<sup>6</sup>/<sub>5</sub>, BG<sup>4</sup>/<sub>3</sub>, and written on
the score by three dots and their chromas,&mdash;7, 5, and 3 (see <a
href = "#fig23">Fig.&nbsp;23</a>).</p>

<p><a name = "para161" id = "para161">(161)</a>
3. The inward path which leads by increase of gray to the neutral
centre, and on to the opposite hue red-purple,
RP<sup>4</sup>/<sub>5</sub>, is full of pitfalls for the inexpert. It
combines great change of hue and chroma, with small change of value.</p>

<p><a name = "para162" id = "para162">(162)</a>
If any other color point be chosen in place of gray-green, the same
typical paths are just as easily traced, written by the notation, and
recorded on the color score.</p>

<h5>These paths trace sequences from any point in the color solid.</h5>

<p><a name = "para163" id = "para163">(163)</a>
In the construction of the color solid we saw that its scales were made
of equal steps in hue, value, and chroma, and tested by balance on the
centre of neutral gray. Any step will serve as a point of departure to
trace regular sequences of the three types. The vertical type is a
sequence of value only. It is somewhat tame, lacking the change of hue
and chroma, but giving a monotonous harmony of regular values. The
horizontal type traces a sequence of neighboring hues, less tame than
the vertical type, but monotonous in value and chroma. The inward type
connects opposite hues by a sequence of chroma balanced on middle gray,
and is more stimulating to the eyes.</p>

<p><a name = "para164" id = "para164">(164)</a>
These paths have so far been treated as made up of equal steps in each
direction, with the accompanying idea of equal quantities of color at
each step. But by using <i>unequal quantities of color</i>, the balance
may be preserved by compensations to the intervals that separate the
colors (see paragraphs <a href = "#para109">109, 110</a>).</p>

<h5>Unequal color quantities compensated by relations of hue, value, and
chroma.</h5>

<p><a name = "para165" id = "para165">(165)</a>
Small bits of powerful color can be used to balance large
<span class = "pagenum">90</span>
fields of weak chroma. For instance, a&nbsp;spot of strong reddish
purple is balanced and enhanced by a field of gray-green. So an amethyst
pin at the neck of the girl’s dress will appear to advantage with the
gown, and also with the Leghorn straw. But a large field of strong
color, such as a cloth jacket of reddish purple, would be fatal to the
measured harmony we seek.</p>

<p><a name = "para166" id = "para166">(166)</a>
This use of a small point of strong chroma, if repeated at intervals,
sets up a notion of rhythm; but, in order to be rhythmic, there must be
recurrent emphasis, “a&nbsp;succession of similar units, combining
unlike elements.” This quality must not be confused with the unaccented
succession, seen in a measured scale of hue, value, or chroma.</p>

<h5>Paper masks to isolate color intervals.</h5>

<p><a name = "para167" id = "para167">(167)</a>
A sheet of paper large enough to hide the color sphere may be perforated
with three or more openings in a straight line, and applied against the
surface, so as to isolate the steps of any sequence which we wish to
study. Thus the sequence given in paragraph <a href =
"#para160">160</a>&mdash;Y<sup>8</sup>/<sub>7</sub>,
G<sup>6</sup>/<sub>5</sub>, BG<sup>4</sup>/<sub>3</sub>&mdash;may be
changed to bring it on the surface of the sphere, when it reads
Y<sup>8</sup>/<sub>3</sub>, G<sup>6</sup>/<sub>5</sub>,
BG<sup>5</sup>/<sub>5</sub>. A&nbsp;mask with round holes, spaced so as
to uncover these three spots, relieves the eye from the distraction of
other colors. Keeping the centre spot on green, the mask may be moved so
as to study the effect of changing hue or value of the other two steps
in the sequence.</p>

<p><a name = "para168" id = "para168">(168)</a>
The sequence is lightened by sliding the whole mask upward, and darkened
by dropping it lower. Then the result of using the same intervals in
another field is easily studied by moving the mask to another part of
the solid.</p>

<p><a name = "para169" id = "para169">(169)</a>
Change of interval immediately modifies the character of a color
sequence. This is readily shown by having an under-mask, with a long,
continuous slit, and an over-mask whose perforations
<span class = "pagenum">91</span>
are arranged in several rows, each row giving different spaces between
the perforations. In the case of the girl’s clothing, the same sequence
produces quite a different effect, if two perforations of the over-mask
are brought nearer to select a lighter yellow-green dress, while the
ends of the sequence remain unchanged. To move the middle perforation
near the other end, selects a darker bluish green dress, on which the
trimming will be less contrasted, while the hat appears brighter than
before, because of greater contrast.</p>

<p><a name = "para170" id = "para170">(170)</a>
The variations of color sequence which can thus be studied out by simple
masks are almost endless; yet upon a measured system the character of
each effect is easily described, and, if need be, preserved by a written
record.</p>

<h5>Invention of color groups.</h5>

<p><a name = "para171" id = "para171">(171)</a>
Experiments with variable masks for the selection of color intervals,
such as have been described, soon stimulate the imagination, so that it
conceives sequences through any part of the color solid. The color image
becomes a permanent mental adjunct. Five middle colors, tempered with
white and black, permit us to devise the greatest variety of sequences,
some light, others dark, some combining small difference of chroma with
large difference of hue, others uniting large intervals of chroma with
small intervals of hue, and so on through a well-nigh inexhaustible
series.</p>

<p><a name = "para172" id = "para172">(172)</a>
As this constructive imagination gains power, the solid and its charts
may be laid aside. <i>We can now think color consecutively.</i> Each
color suggests its place in the system, and may be taken as a point of
departure for the invention of groups to carry out a desired
relation.</p>

<p><a name = "para173" id = "para173">(173)</a>
This selective mental process is helped by the score described

in the last chapter; and the quantity of each color chosen for the group
is easily indicated by a variable circle, drawn round the various points
on the diagram. Thus, in the case of the child’s clothes, a&nbsp;large
circle around G<sup>6</sup>/<sub>5</sub> gives the area of that color as
compared with smaller circles around Y<sup>8</sup>/<sub>7</sub> and
BG<sup>4</sup>/<sub>3</sub>, representing the area of the straw and the
trimming.</p>

<p><a name = "para174" id = "para174">(174)</a>
When the plotting of color groups has become instinctive from long
practice, it opens a wide field of color study. Take as illustration the
wings of butterflies or the many varieties of pansies. These fascinating
color schemes can be written with indications of area that record their
differences by a simple diagram. In the same way, rugs, tapestries,
mosaics,&mdash;whatever attracts by its beauty and harmony of
color,&mdash;can be recorded and studied in measured terms; and the
mental process of estimating hues, values, chromas, and areas by
established scales must lead the color sense to finer and finer
perceptions.</p>

<p>The same process serves as well to record the most annoying and
inharmonious color groups. When sufficient of these records have been
obtained, they furnish definite material for a contrast of the color
combinations which please, with those that cause disgust. Such a
contrast should discover some broad law of color harmony. It will then
be in measured terms which can be clearly given; not a vague personal
statement, conveying different meanings to each one who
hears&nbsp;it.</p>

<h5>Constant exercise needed to train the color sense.</h5>

<p><a name = "para175" id = "para175">(175)</a>
Appreciation of beautiful color grows by exercise and discrimination,
just as naturally as fine perception of music or literature. Each is an
outlet for the expression of taste,&mdash;a language which may be used
clumsily or with skill.</p>

<p><a name = "para176" id = "para176">(176)</a>
As color perception becomes finer, it discards the more
<span class = "pagenum">93</span>
crude and violent contrasts. A&nbsp;child revels in strong chromas, but
the mark of a colorist is ability to employ low chroma without
impoverishing the color effect. As a boy’s shrieks and groans can be
tempered to musical utterance, so his debauches in violent red, green,
and purple must be replaced by tempered hues.</p>

<p><a name = "para177" id = "para177">(177)</a>
Raphael, Titian, Velasquez, Corot, Chavannes, and Whistler are masters
in the use of gray. Personal bias may lead one colorist a little more
toward warm colors, and another slightly toward the cool field, in each
case attaining a sense of harmonious balance by tempered degrees of
value and chroma.<a class = "tag" name = "tag33" id = "tag33" href =
"#note33">33</a></p>

<p><a name = "para178" id = "para178">(178)</a>
It is not claimed that discipline in the use of subtle colors will make
another Corot or Velasquez, but it will make for comprehension of their
skill. It is grotesque to watch gaudily dressed persons going into
ecstasies over the delicate coloring of a Botticelli, when the internal
as well as the external evidence is against them.</p>

<p><a name = "para179" id = "para179">(179)</a>
The colors which we choose, not only in personal apparel, but in our
rooms and decorations, are mute witnesses to a stage of color
perception.</p>

<p>If that perception is trained to finer distinctions, the mind can no
longer be content with coarse expression. It begins to feel an
incongruity between the “loud” color of the wall paper, bought because
it was fashionable, and the quiet hues of the rug, which was a gift from
some artistic friend. It sees that, although the furniture is covered
with durable and costly materials, their color “swears” at that of the
curtains and wood-work. In short, the
<span class = "pagenum">94</span>
room has been jumbled together at various periods, without any plan or
sense of color design.</p>

<p><a name = "para180" id = "para180">(180)</a>
Good taste demands that a room be furnished, not alone for convenience
and comfort, but also with an eye to the beauty of the various objects,
so that, instead of confusing and destroying the colors, each may
enhance the other. And, when this sense of color harmony is aroused, it
selects and arranges the books, the rugs, the lamp shade, the souvenirs
of travel and friendship, the wall paper, pictures, and hangings, so
that they fit into a color scheme, not only charming to the eye at first
glance, but which continues to please the mind as it traces out an
intelligent plan, bringing all into general harmony.</p>

<p><a name = "para181" id = "para181">(181)</a>
Nor will this cease when one room has been put to rights. Such a
coloristic attitude is not satisfied until the vista into the next
apartment is made attractive. Or should there be a suite of rooms, it
demands that, with variety in each one, they all be brought into
harmonious sequence. Thus the study of color finds immediate and
practical use in daily life. It is a needed discipline of color vision,
in the sense that geometry is a discipline of the mind, and it also
enters into the pleasure and refinement of life at every step. Skill or
awkwardness in its use exerts as positive an influence upon us as do the
harmonies and discords of sound, and a far more continuous one. It is
thought a defect to be unmusical. Should it not be considered a mark of
defective cultivation to be insensitive to color?</p>

<p><a name = "para182" id = "para182">(182)</a>
In this slight sketch of color education it has been assumed that we are
to deal with those who have normal perceptions. But there are some who
inherit or develop various degrees of color-blindness; and a word in
their behalf may be opportune.</p>

<p><a name = "para183" id = "para183">(183)</a>
A case of total color-blindness is very rare, but a few
<span class = "pagenum">95</span>
are on record. When a child shows deficient color perception,<a class =
"tag" name = "tag34" id = "tag34" href = "#note34">34</a> a&nbsp;little
care may save him much discomfort, and patient training may correct it.
If he mismatches some hues, confuses their names, seems incapable of the
finer distinctions of color, study to find the hues which he estimates
well, and then help him to venture a little into that field where his
perception is at fault. Improvement is pretty sure to follow when this
is sympathetically done. One student, who never outgrew the habit of
giving a purplish hue to all his work, despite many expedients and the
use of various lights and colored objects to correct it, is the single
exception among hundreds whom it has been my privilege to watch as they
improved their first crude estimates, and gained skill in expressing
their sense of Nature’s subtle color.</p>

<p class = "space">
<a name = "para184" id = "para184">(184)</a>
To sum up, the first chapter suggests a measured color system in place
of guess-work. The next describes the three color qualities, and
sketches a child’s growth in color perception. The third tells how
colors may be mingled in such proportions as to balance. After the
impracticability of using spectral color has been shown in the fourth
chapter, the fifth proceeds to build a practical color solid. The sixth
provides for a written record of color, and the last applies all that
has preceded to suggestions for the study of color harmony.</p>

<p><a name = "para185" id = "para185">(185)</a>
Wide gaps appear in this outline. There is much that deserves fuller
treatment. But, if the search for refined color and a clearer outlook
upon its relations are stimulated by this fragmentary sketch, some of
its faults may be overlooked.</p>

Professor James says there are three classic stages in the career of a
theory: “First, it is attacked as absurd; then admitted to be true, but
obvious and insignificant; finally it is seen to be so important that
its adversaries claim to be its discoverers.”</p>

<p><a name = "note33" id = "note33" href = "#tag33">33.</a>
“Nature’s most lively hues are bathed in lilac grays. Spread all about
us, yet visible only to the fine perception of the colorist, is this
gray quality by which he appeals. Not he whose pictures abound in
‘<i>couleurs voyantes</i>,’ but he who preserves in his work all the
‘<i>gris colorés</i>’ is the good colorist.”</p>

hues which stand midway in the scales of <span class =

Strictly speaking, their five intermediates are also midway of the
scales; but they are obtained by mixture of the five principal hues, as

<div class = "glossary">

<p><span class = "smallcaps">After Image.</span>&mdash;An image
perceived after withdrawing the eye from a brilliantly illuminated
object. Such images are called positive when their colors are the same
as that of the object, and negative when they are its complementary
colors.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Blue.</span>&mdash;Of the color of the
clear sky; of the color of the spectrum between wave lengths .505 and
.415 micron, and more especially .487 and .460; or of such light mixed
with white; azure, cerulean.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Black.</span>&mdash;Possessing in the
highest degree the property of absorbing light; reflecting and
transmitting little or no light; of the color of soot or coal; of the
darkest possible hue; sable. Optically, wholly destitute of color, or
absolutely dark, whether from the absence or the total absorption of
light. Opposed to white.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Brown.</span>&mdash;A dark color, inclined
to red or yellow, obtained by mixing red, black, and yellow.</p>

<p><b>CHROMA.&mdash;The degree of departure of a color sensation from
that of white or gray; the intensity of distinctive hue; color
intensity.</b></p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Chromatic.</span>&mdash;Relating to or of
the nature of color.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Cobalt Blue.</span>&mdash;A pure blue
tending toward cyan blue and of high luminosity; also called Hungary
blue, Lethner’s blue, and Paris blue.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">108</span>
<p><span class = "smallcaps">Color.</span>&mdash;Objectively, that
quality of a thing or appearance which is perceived by the eye alone,
independently of the form of the thing; subjectively, a&nbsp;sensation
peculiar to the organ of vision, and arising from the optic nerve.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Color Blindness.</span>&mdash;Incapacity
for perceiving colors, independent of the capacity for distinguishing
light and shade. The most common form is inability to perceive red as a
distinct color, red objects being confounded with gray or green; and
next in frequency is the inability to perceive green.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Color Constants.</span>&mdash;The numbers
which measure the quantities, as well as any other system of three
numbers for defining colors, are called constants of color.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Color Variables.</span>&mdash;Colors vary
in <span class = "smallroman">CHROMA</span>, or freedom from admixture
of white light; in <span class = "smallroman">BRIGHTNESS</span>, or
luminosity; and in <span class = "smallroman">HUE</span>, which roughly
corresponds to the mean wave length of the light emitted.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Colors, Complementary.</span>&mdash;Those
pairs of color which when mixed produce white or gray light, such as red
and green-blue, yellow and indigo-blue, green-yellow and violet.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Colors, Primary.</span>&mdash;The red,
green, and violet light of the spectrum, from the mixture of which all
other colors can be produced. Also called fundamental colors.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Dyestuffs.</span>&mdash;In commerce, any
dyewood, lichen, or dyecake used in dyeing and staining.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Electric Light.</span>&mdash;Light produced
by electricity and of two general kinds, the arc light and the
incandescent light. In the first the voltaic arc is employed. In the
second a resisting conductor is rendered incandescent by the
current.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Enamel.</span>&mdash;In the fine arts a
vitreous substance or glass, opaque or transparent, and variously
colored, applied as a coating on a surface of metal or of porcelain.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">109</span>
<p><span class = "smallcaps">Grating, Diffraction.</span>&mdash;A series
of fine parallel lines on a surface of glass, or polished metal, ruled
very close together, at the rate of 10,000 to 20,000 or even 40,000 to
the inch; distinctively called a diffraction or a diffraction grating,
much used in spectroscopic work.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Gray.</span>&mdash;A color having little or
no distinctive hue (<span class = "smallroman">CHROMA</span>) and only
moderate luminosity.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Green.</span>&mdash;The color of ordinary
foliage; the color seen in the solar spectrum between wave lengths 0.511
and 0.543 micron.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Emerald Green.</span>&mdash;A highly
chromatic and extraordinarily luminous green of the color of the
spectrum at wave length 0.524 micron. It recalls the emerald by its
brilliancy, but not by its tint; applied generally to the aceto-arsenate
of copper. Usually known as Paris green.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">High Color.</span>&mdash;A hue which
excites intensely chromatic color sensations.</p>

<p><b>HUE.&mdash;Specifically and technically, distinctive quality of
coloring in an object or on a surface; the respect in which red, yellow,
green, blue, etc., differ one from another; that in which colors of
equal luminosity and CHROMA may differ.</b></p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Indigo.</span>&mdash;The violet-blue color
of the spectrum, extending, according to Helmholtz, from G two-thirds of
the way to F in the prismatic spectrum. The name was introduced by
Newton, but has lately been discarded by the best writers.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Light.</span>&mdash;Adjective applied to
colors highly luminous and more or less deficient in <span class =
"smallroman">CHROMA</span>.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Luminosity.</span>&mdash;Specifically, the
intensity of light in a color, measured photometrically; that is to say,
a&nbsp;standard light has its intensity, or <i>vis viva</i>, altered,
until it produces the impression of being equally bright with the color
whose light is to be
<span class = "pagenum">110</span>
determined; and the measure of the <i>vis viva</i> of the altered light,
relatively to its standard intensity, is then taken as the luminosity of
the color in question.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Maxwell Color Discs.</span>&mdash;Discs
having each a single color, and slit radially so that one may be made to
lap over another to any desired extent. By rotating these on a spindle,
the effect of combining certain colors in varying proportions can be
studied.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Micron.</span>&mdash;The millionth part of
a metre, or 1/23400 of an English inch. The term has been formally
adopted by the International Commission of Weights and Measures,
representing the civilized nations of the world, and is adopted by all
metrologists.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Orange.</span>&mdash;A reddish yellow
color, of which the orange is the type.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Vision, Persistence of.</span>&mdash;The
continuance of a visual impression upon the retina of the eye after the
exciting cause is removed. The length of time varies with the intensity
of the light and the excitability of the retina, and ordinarily is
brief, though the duration may be for hours, or even days. The after
image may be either positive or negative, the latter when the bright
part appears dark and the colored parts in their corresponding contrast
colors. It is because of this persistence that, for example,
a&nbsp;firebrand moved very rapidly appears as a band or circle of
light.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Photometer.</span>&mdash;An instrument used
to measure the intensity of light. Specifically, to compare the relative
intensities of the light emitted from various sources.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Pigment.</span>&mdash;Any substance that is
or can be used by painters to impart color to bodies.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Pink.</span>&mdash;A red color of low
chroma, but high luminosity, inclining toward purple.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">111</span>
<p><span class = "smallcaps">Primary Colors.</span>&mdash;See Colors,
primary.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Pure Color.</span>&mdash;A color produced
by homogeneous light. Any very brilliant or decided color.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Purple.</span>&mdash;A color formed by the
mixture of blue and red, including the violet of the spectrum above wave
length 0.417, which is nearly a violet blue, and extending to, but not
including, crimson.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Rainbow.</span>&mdash;A bow or an arc of a
circle, consisting of the prismatic colors, formed by the refraction and
the reflection of rays of light from drops of rain or vapor, appearing
in the part of the heavens opposite to the sun.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Red.</span>&mdash;A color more or less
resembling that of blood, or the lower end of the spectrum. Red is one
of the most general color names, and embraces colors ranging in hue from
aniline to scarlet iodide of mercury and red lead. A&nbsp;red yellower
than vermilion is called scarlet. One much more crimson is called
crimson red. A&nbsp;very dark red, if pure or crimson, is called maroon;
if brownish, chestnut or chocolate. A&nbsp;pale red&mdash;that is, one
of low <span class = "smallroman">CHROMA</span> and high <span class =
"smallroman">LUMINOSITY</span>&mdash;is called a pink, ranging from rose
pink or pale crimson to salmon pink or pale scarlet.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Venetian Red.</span>&mdash;An important
pigment used by artists, somewhat darker than brick red in color, and
very permanent.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Retina.</span>&mdash;The innermost and
chiefly nervous coat of the posterior part of the eyeball.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Saturation, of Colors.</span>&mdash;In
optics the degree of admixture with white, the saturation diminishing as
the amount of white is increased. In other words, the highest degree of
saturation belongs to a given color when in the state of greatest
purity.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">112</span>
<p><span class = "smallcaps">Scale.</span>&mdash;A graded system, by
reference to which the degree, intensity, or quality of a sense
perception may be estimated.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Shade.</span>&mdash;Degree or gradation of
defective luminosity in a color, often used vaguely from the fact that
paleness, or high luminosity, combined with defective <span class =
"smallroman">CHROMA</span>, is confounded with high luminosity by
itself. See Color, Hue, and Tint.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Spectrum.</span>&mdash;In physics the
continuous band of light showing the successive prismatic colors, or the
isolated lines or bands of color, observed when the radiation from such
a source as the sun or an ignited vapor in a gas flame is viewed after
having been passed through a prism (prismatic spectrum) or reflected
from a diffraction grating (diffraction or interference spectrum). See
Rainbow.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Tint.</span>&mdash;A variety of color;
especially and properly, a&nbsp;luminous variety of low <span class =
"smallroman">CHROMA</span>; also, abstractly, the respect in which a
color may be raised by more or less admixture of white, which at once
increases the luminosity and diminishes the <span class =
"smallroman">CHROMA.</span></p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Tone.</span>&mdash;A sound having
definiteness and continuity enough so that its pitch, force, and quality
may be readily estimated by the ear. Musical sound opposed to noise. The
prevailing effect of a color.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Ultramarine.</span>&mdash;A beautiful
natural blue pigment, obtained from the mineral lapis-lazuli.</p>

<p><b>VALUE.&mdash;In painting and the allied arts, relation of one
object, part, or atmospheric plane of a picture to the others, with
reference to light and shade, the idea of HUE being abstracted.</b></p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Vermilion.</span>&mdash;The red sulphate of
mercury.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Violet.</span>&mdash;A general class of
colors, of which the violet flower is a
<span class = "pagenum">113</span>
highly chromatic example. The sensation is produced by a pure blue whose
<span class = "smallroman">CHROMA</span> has been diminished while its
<span class = "smallroman">LUMINOSITY</span> has been increased. Thus
blue and violet are the same color, though the sensations are different.
A&nbsp;mere increase of illumination may cause a violet blue to appear
violet, with a diminution of apparent <span class =
"smallroman">CHROMA</span>. This color, called violet or blue according
to the quality of the sensation it excites, is one of the three
fundamental colors of Young’s theory. A&nbsp;deep blue tinged with
red.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Viridian.</span>&mdash;Same as Veronese
green.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">White.</span>&mdash;A color transmitting,
and so reflecting to the eye, all the rays of the spectrum, combined in
the same proportion as in the impinging light.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Yellow.</span>&mdash;The color of gold and
of light, of wave length 0.581 micron. The name is restricted to highly
chromatic and luminous colors. When reduced in <span class =
"smallroman">CHROMA</span>, it becomes buff; when reduced in <span class
= "smallroman">LUMINOSITY</span>, a&nbsp;cool brown. See Brown.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Veronese Green.</span>&mdash;A pigment
consisting of hydrated chromium sesquioxide. It is a clear bluish green
of great permanency. Also called Viridian.</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
